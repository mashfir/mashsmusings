        After thinking about the whole logistic regression thing for a while, I was confused how we got to the magic e^x function considering our goal was merely to go from a crude linear approximation of a probability to a meaningful probability bounded between 0 and 1. While there are infinitely many ways to get there, here are a few arguably simpler examples I came up with to also achieve the same outcome. Notably, I was curious why we do we not use the x/abs(x) version when that gives us a much crisper binary outcome?[0]

        The problem breaks down into answering the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>How can we make sure our output is positive?</li>
          <li>And how can we make sure our output is bounded at 1?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          But thinking about this, we can see that there are infinitely many ways to do this. So again, why an exponential?
        </p>
        <p>
          I can come up with intuitions that help us understand why we use the equation we use[1]:
An exponential reflects the idea that an increase in X result in an increase in p(X) and a decrease in X results in a decrease in p(X). In other words, a negative coefficient means a decrease in probability and vice versa.[2] 
        </p>
        <p>
          Exponentials? :check:  Lines? :check: Squares? :x: Absolute? :x:
        </p>
        <p>
          An exponential, by definition, reflects the idea that the effect a step change in X has on p(X) depends on our current value of X.[3] In other words, if we’re considering the effect of income on probability of default, it matters whether we are going from an income of $0k–$10k vs $200k–$210k.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exponentials? :check:  Lines? :x: Squares? :check:  Absolute? :x:
        </p>
        <p>
          And what about the +1 in the denominator? We could have used any number > 0. It seems 1 is just a convenient choice to help give meaning to p(X) / (1-p(X)). We could just as correctly use +2 or +3, but then we would just be carrying around a factor of 2 or 3. So we just pick +1 arbitrarily to make things simpler.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hopefully these ramblings kind of help understand the seemingly magical appearance of e^x in this application. As with a lot of other statistical applications, the formula chosen is due to thoughtful convenience and not an absolute truth.

          [0] You can just as legitimately use x/abs(x) to create your own binary classifier.
        </p>
        <p>
          [1] These may not be the actual reasons why this equation was chosen…
        </p>
        <p>
          [2] I guess this really just means that we want dy/dx > 0 for all x?
        </p>
        <p>
          [3] I guess this really just means that we want d^2y/dx^2 ≠ 0?
