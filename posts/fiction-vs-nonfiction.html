      <h4>Published May. 16, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        On my site's <a href="/books/">reading list</a> I decided for the
        absolutely minimal amount of classification possible to avoid the mess
        of having to rank books or cateogorize adding them in, landing on a
        simple fiction vs nonfiction. I've been satisfied by been satisfied by
        my choice up until a conversation about the book I was to read next,
        "You're reading the Bible? Would that classify as fiction or
        nonfiction?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Like with any good tough, potentially philosophical question, I
        immediately looked to the Internet for an answer. I read one Quora
        answer and thought I'd be satisfied.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The bible is nonfiction as in 'not fiction'. Fiction refers to a novel
        or collection of short stories."
      </p>
      <p>
        Case closed, or so I thought. Had I stopped there, perhaps it would have
        been. But my eyes went to the next answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It depends on who you ask. Some people pay call it fiction and others
        nonfiction, and others neither at all."
      </p>
      <p>
        Each successive answer confused me more. I was honestly expecting the
        typical Internet two-sided shouting match. But instead, I found a
        dizzying potpourri.
      </p>
      <p>
        More digging and more confusion. It seems like I was not going to find a
        clear answer here. There seemed to be a general consensus that my
        perfect binary taxonomy was not sufficient. So how to solve this problem
        of where to add the Bible while still keeping the minimalist effort I
        desired? Simple. Remove all classification. So whenever I finally get
        through that behemoth of a book, gone will be the old class system, all
        books will unite as one. But while all books will be equal, some books
        may be <em>more</em> equal than others. Stay tuned.
