        Imagine a delicious plate of pad thai, fresh and ready to eat. You can
        smell the peanuts and chili powder. You can see the steam rising as you
        prepare yourself for the first bite.
      </p>

        If you're like me, then this thought probably elicited at least somewhat
        of Pavlovian response. You probably have at least a little bit more
        saliva at the ready for the pad thai that's not there. No worries, we
        can just swallow the extra saliva and move on with our day. Nothing
        weird about that last bit, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Now instead imagine spitting that extra saliva into a clean cup. And
        imagine swallowing the saliva from that cup. Yeah... <em>Bleh</em>.
      </p>

        What is it about these two acts that elicits such a different response
        from our brain? By all reason we should be pretty much indifferent
        between these two acts. Yet despite all our enlightened faculties, some
        deep primal disgust cannot be overriden. How strange our neurochemistry
        is, and how poorly we understand it. Next time you feel disgust or
        revulsion, pause to think about; it's likely you do far more disgusting
        things on a daily basis.
