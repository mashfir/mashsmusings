        Looking back, this question has had many different answers at many
        different times in my life. While most people will state with absolute
        certainty their current reason for learning history, there is often far
        more nuance. And with the constant battles to propagandize school
        curriculums one way or another, it's worth being clear on what the goal
        is.
      </p>
      <p>
        My earliest recollection of learning history is in fifth grade. We
        covered ancient civilizations (i.e. Egypt) before spending the rest of
        the time on the Middle Ages in Europe. The purpose was to get a sense of
        how human beings, just like me, had for many many years lived vastly
        different lives; going so far as to dress up and roleplay different
        characters in a medieval banquet (I was a nobleman of course). This
        broader cultural awareness can be powerful and is often a discount
        version of the benefits of traveling as a child.

        After that began the long arc of Canadian history. Starting with
        voyageurs and the fight for Canadian independence in grade school,
        taking a weird detour into residential schools in early high school, and
        culminating in Canada's involvement in the World Wars and the
        definitely-pivotal-and-totally-earth-shattering Battle of Vimy Ridge. In
        hindsight, I realize that this whole curriculum was designed to build up
        a national identity in teenagers starting to discover themselves, to
        really instill a sense of Canadian pride with values such as humility
        and courage. History became a tool to impress upon me the values of the
        society I was growing up in; an empowering experience if done right and
        a catalyst for bitter conflict if done wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout this period, my contemporary self never really questioned the
        value of learning history. The reason was clear: learning history, like
        keeping up with current events, was the entry ticket to the
        intelligentsia. It was a way to feel superior and knowledgeable.
        History, news, and politics were the trifecta for qualifying as a
        learned adult. While that reason didn't last, it did at least serve as
        an entry ticket to a seat on our school's Reach for the Top team,
        catapulting me to instant fame and generating unbounded sex appeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        After high school, upon realizing that there were armies of people more
        knowledgeable than me, I was left to fill my panicked insecurity through
        other intellectual flexes. And thus, my relationship with history
        changed again. The little history I would come across was purely for
        entertainment. As true crime has proven over the past couple of decades,
        historical events can capture the human psyche more completely than even
        the best Agatha Christie novel. In such a way did history, in the form
        of The 300 Spartans or the drama of the Middle East, persist in the
        peripheries of college life.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few years later I crossed the final threshold of human awakening:
        paying taxes. History then became a powerful tool to backtest different
        systems of governance and life. A way to try and answer why Canada had
        adopted certain social systems while the US had adopted others. And
        while we should be cautious about trying to extrapolate the benefits of
        shogunates in 21st century California, learning history does help glean
        potential consequences of communism or fascism.
      </p>

        I realize now that there is no best reason for why we should learn
        history. I urge you to pause and reflect on why you think it's valuable.
        And what part of that value you want to pass onto children, keeping in
        mind that curriculums are zero-sum. Are we trying to teach different
        perspectives or are we indoctrinating? History repeats itself, but we
        should be careful about what we want to repeat.
