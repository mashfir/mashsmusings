      <h4>Published Sep. 11, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        In my recent
        <a href="/posts/politician-or-platform.html" target="_blank">post</a> on
        voting for politicians, I stated that voting solely on a politician is a
        vote of trust. Trust that they are sincere in their views and trust that
        they will be able to execute on their promises. With friends, we gain
        this trust over time by observing behavior in different situations. If a
        friend speaks of loyalty, are they there when you need help? How well do
        they perform at work or execute in cases where they are responsible for
        something? Whether this trust was built consciously, it exists in some
        measure for everyone you know. Can we reasonably extend this trust to
        our favorite politicians?
      </p>
      <p>
        Like all good yes-no questions, the answer is "it depends". Breaking it
        down, it helps to check how much of a politician's behavior we have
        really seen. For an incumbent, we get to live the post-script of an
        election campaign. Their face graces our screens on any newsworthy
        occasion and their slights instantly make headlines. We can keep a
        mental, or these days
        <a href="https://www.polimeter.org/en/trudeau" target="_blank"
          >digital</a
        >, record of how many promises they've kept and weight those against our
        personal values. The longer the incumbent is in power, the more behavior
        we see and the wider variety of situations we see handled. Whether
        friend or foe, there accumulates enough data points to form an opinion
        on how well they wield power. But what of the rest of the candidates?
      </p>
      <p>
        After losing an election, most candidates fade away into obscurity. I
        imagine they go to the same island for respite as Tupac or my favorite
        barista when I'm out of town. Yes, some political pundit or poli sci
        major friend may keep tabs on the goings-on of daily politics, but for
        most the next time you'll hear of the candidate is through election or
        scandal. All the campaign promises made and all the values stood for
        stand untested. There is no data available on how they would perform in
        power, no data upon which to build that deeper level of trust. What
        remains is only a vague hypothetical of the leader that could have been.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practical terms, this effectively means that voting based on
        politicians is a vote of confidence for the incumbent. Voting
        <em>for</em> the incumbent is a vote based on trust earned, voting
        <em>against</em> is a vote based on trust lost. The specifics on who you
        choose in the latter scenario is necessarily based on a much weaker form
        of trust, one based on belief rather than evidence. It's important to
        keep this asymmetry in mind when there is no counterfactual. The
        decision harkens to the old Irish proverb, is it better the devil you
        know, or the devil you don't?
