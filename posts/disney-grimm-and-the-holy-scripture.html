        The moment I first learned about <em>Grimm's Fairy Tales</em>, I was
        floored. Having grown up watching boxes of old Disney VHS tapes, I had
        come to believe that all children's tales followed the whitewashed arcs
        accessible to even the most coddled children. And while I still think
        Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a beautifully animated and fun movie,
        it's just not quite the same knowing that the stepmother's original
        intention was to harvest Sneewittchen's organs for consumption.
      </p>

        Recently I have been having the same experience going through the Old
        Testament and realizing how R-rated it is compared to popular references
        and interpretations. My preconceived notion was of this old stuffy book
        filled with draconian rules that nobody really follows &mdash; and in
        some ways that is true. But what they don't tell you is that the
        overwhelming majority covers the spectrum of life that I guess was
        typical for 1500 BC; including numerous genocides, rapes, kidnappings,
        and instances of human trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
        What they don't tell you is that the story of Samson is as much about
        his philandering as it is about his strength. That Noah gets wasted and
        presumably fondled by his son after saving life on Earth. Or that the
        story of Moses is as much about massacring the native Canaanites for a
        land grab as it is about freeing the slaves from Egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
        While these stories are beyond the pale today, they portray a far more
        believable and ultimately compelling narrative of how a religious
        identity is formed. The <em>need</em> to unify around a Founding Myth
        and to execute on it at all costs becomes clear only in relation to the
        contemporary alternatives. And the suffering and misery that follows
        from a failure to adhere to the ideals are what reinforce the message.
      </p>

        Colored by those early Disney movies, my expectation was that these
        stories were filled with white knights overcoming some singular tragic
        flaw to save the people from the obvious tyrant. But I'm glad that it is
        turning out to be more Sneewittchen than Snow White &mdash; the tales of
        envy, revenge, and petty ambition are as relatable today as they were
        then. Despite more than 3000 years of wisdom handed down from cultures
        across the world and unbelievable material wealth, it seems the human
        condition has remained unchanged.
