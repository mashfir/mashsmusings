        One of the most common pieces of advice is to not get too emotionally
        invested in one company or job. There are many reasons, often out of
        your control, that determine whether or not you may receive an offer.
        Even if you have some roles you are especially excited about, it's
        important to realize that on some level job hunting is always a numbers
        game. Having multiple offers in hand allows for leverage to boost
        compensation and optimize for the best fit. This is all extremely
        reasonable advice that I regularly give. That said, I have confession to
        make:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I have never had more than a single outstanding offer in hand.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not for lack of trying mind you, I have cast a wide net many times,
        especially in college. I have just failed to get more than one at a time
        which has led to my decisions being fairly straightforward.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is fine! I would even go so far as to say this is expected if you
        keep pushing the boundaries of what you thought possible. You don't
        <em>need</em> to have multiple offers to make a decision and it would be
        counterproductive to let good open offers expire solely to get more
        options or leverage.

        of amnesiac patients, it was found that participants given a Monet print
        with the option to come back later and swap out the print not only liked
        the print they chose <em>less</em> than those who just had to stick with
        one, but grew to like <em>all</em> of the prints less! The moral is to
        avoid pursuing lots of offers as the end goal, the moral is to interview
        widely with the intention of finding at least one offer that is right
        for you. As an upward stumbler, I assure you that all you need is one.
