        on things learned way too late in life. While there are certainly no
        shortage of such things to share, I have found some of my biggest "woah"
        moments in the last few years to be in the world of computers. Being
        pretty new to the field and largely self-taught, I consistently have the
        bittersweet experience of noticing a glaring blindspot and the lightbulb
        moment once the gap is filled in.

        When I was younger, though not young enough that I want to divulge a
        specific age, my thought was that file extensions were something magical
        that dictated what a file was. Like some sort of digital cargo culter, I
        remember at some point attempting to rename some random file "Need for
        Speed.exe" in the hopes that I could manifest the video games my parents
        refused to purchase for me. My mental model of file extensions was akin
        to incantations in a spellbook: where the right set of words in the
        right order would produce a magic effect. I interpreted my inability to
        turn English homework into video games as a failure in execution, not
        understanding; and I was disappointed that I did not know the right set
        of magic words to achieve my noble goal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps when Harry Potter introduced dementors and Hermione became hot,
        my magical fantasies shifted towards killing ghosts and kissing cuties,
        and I gave up on trying to manifest magic in the world. My understanding
        of file extensions at this time was updated to a conception that it was
        some sort of magic property of the file that was not to be tampered
        with. I'd imagine this had to do with the scary dialog boxes that
        previous versions of Windows would hit me with every time I veered to
        the right of the '.' when renaming a file. On the occasions when I
        steeled my nerves and boldly renamed the file in brazen defiance of the
        warnings, I found that, as promised, Windows no longer knew what to do
        with my file. Like poor Icarus, I had flown too close to the sun and I
        was grateful that while Daedalus had to watch his son perish, Bill Gates
        had provided me with the ability to ctrl+z my hubris away. My file
        extensions were restored and the damage was undone.

        It wasn't until my 20s when I was learning the basics of programming
        that something clicked. One exercise had me create a text file for
        manipulation &mdash; not a Microsoft Word .doc which is what I had
        always thought was a text file &mdash; but the equivalent of opening up
        Notepad, typing "hello world", and saving the result as
        "hello_world.txt". Boiled down to such simplicity, it dawned on my that
        regardless of whether I changed this file name to "potato.txt",
        "hello_world.text", or "Need for Speed.exe", the actual file would only
        &mdash; no <em>could only</em> &mdash; contain the same 11 characters;
        the file <em>name</em> had nothing to do with the file
        <em>contents</em>. With that clarification made, it still left the
        question in my head: What <em>do</em> file extensions do?
      </p>

      <p>
        It turns out that file extensions are simply <em>hints</em> to readers
        of that file name, human or computer program, of what that file
        <em>should</em> contain with no guarantee of what it
        <em>does</em> contain. Simple file extensions like .txt suggest that the
        file contains some text. More complex file extensions, such as .png or
        .mp3, suggest that the file conforms to a specification laid out in some
        official document so that a reader knows exactly how to read the file,
        akin to the jacket of a book specifying "French" or "Russian" as the
        language. The jacket provides helpful information about what I can
        expect in the book but doesn't define the book itself. And like a book
        jacket, a file extension can be misleading, ommitted, or ignored
        entirely while leaving the book unchanged. So while I can swap out the
        original "hello_world.txt" jacket for the "Need for Speed.exe" jacket,
        all that would accomplish is the confusion of future readers, a pattern
        commonly seen in malware masquerading as benign files. I can also remove
        the jacket altogether by renaming the file just "hello_world", and while
        that will cause Windows to get confused about how to read the file, I
        can open read its contents in Notepad all the same. Regardless of what I
        change the extension to, a reader can always attempt to read the book
        anyways and check for itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        It turns out that these little extensions hardly contain the potency I
        once ascribed to them, yet through their relatively humble hints, still
        serve as a critical piece of the process that involves reading and
        writing all manner of files in composing complicated programs. Well it's
        either that, or I still haven't found out the right cheat code to
        manifest all the video games my heart desires.
