        >
        seriously, compensation should be an afterthought when figuring out what
        you want to do. It's hard enough to figure out what you are interested
        in and find a role that matches your interest. Optimize with only that
        in mind and you minimize the chance of day-to-day misery. Switching
        roles primarily based on compensation (or prestige) is socially
        acceptable self-sabotage. If you're unlucky enough to succeed, you will
        quickly realize that there are still people making multiples of what
        you're making and the insecurity that drove the initial move will
        resettle.

      <p>
        It's important to realize that salaries are almost completely
        meaningless in the abstract as a measure of success. Pause to think
        about this for a moment as this is not a commonly held view. What can
        you say about an engineer, a teacher and a chef, all of whom earn a
        salary of $60k? Are they all equally successful? Is a loan shark earning
        $120k twice as successful? Is an artist earning $30k half as successful?
        You may have some moralistic or value judgements here but ultimately
        questions like this have no real answer, your perception of success is a
        mirror onto your values. If your values center around extrinsic things
        such as titles and salary, you will fail to realize them in a lasting
        sense. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. With that belief, put
        compensation out of your mind. On 99% of days, your ability to make a
        direct change to your compensation is nonexistent. As the Stoics said,
        there are things within your control and there are things outside of
        your control, focus only on the former.
      </p>

        That said, there is the other 1%. These are the days in which you are
        shaping performance review discussions or negotiating offers. In these
        situations, <em>obsess about the money</em>. The hard dose of reality is
        that nobody will advocate for what you <em>think</em> is fair, the onus
        is entirely on you to (tactfully) <em>petition</em> for what you need.

        on negotiation so I won't cover specific strategies. Just know that all
        comp numbers are in some sense arbitrary. This does not mean that
        anything is possible, but this does mean that there is always room on
        the table to get more. Ask people in the role for their comp numbers if
        you can, most people are willing to share details if you ask for the
        right reasons. If you don't know anyone, scour the web for comp at
        similar companies, similar roles, or more senior roles and determine the
        absolute upper bound of what is truly possible. Negotiating for yourself
        is never going to feel comfortable, being obsessed helps you push
        through that discomfort. At the end of the day, you may still not get
        what you want; it's okay to not be excited about a role because of comp
        but make sure you weigh that against the initial excitement that got you
        to an offer.
      </p>

        Most importantly, make sure that once you've signed or settled
        performance reviews, <strong>repeat</strong>. That is, ignore
        compensation until the next 1% window. Salary can be an effective
        measure of <em>your</em> success in a given pursuit
        <em>over time</em> but optimizing for money is the ultimate trap. As
        captured elegantly by Goodhart's Law:
