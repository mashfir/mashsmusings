        "Your strengths are your weaknesses". This is something I've heard a few
        times but have come to recently see the wisdom in. Most of the things we
        like about ourselves are usually the things that bring us down in our
        own eyes or those of others. The more we get to really know someone, or
        the less we see ourselves in them, the more likely we are to frame
        things as nuisances or weaknesses as opposed to the strengths. This
        holds most true for ourselves and second most true for family. Here are
        some examples I could think of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>determined vs stubborn</li>
        <li>gentle vs weak</li>
        <li>stoic vs unfeeling</li>
        <li>eager vs naive</li>
        <li>pragmatic vs pessimistic</li>
        <li>cautious vs fearful</li>
        <li>beautiful vs vain</li>
        <li>spontaneous vs disorganized</li>
        <li>organized vs rigid</li>
        <li>analytical vs cold</li>
        <li>brave vs reckless</li>
        <li>loving vs sentimental</li>
        <li>principled vs dogmatic</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The good thing is that we can always reframe things and immediately see
        the effect. Next time you find yourself annoyed at someone, think about
        the strength coming from that weakness. Is the person nagging you or
        displaying concern? Your choice. It's easier to see one side based on
        our mind or interpretation of that person. In our own internal
        narratives we are deeply nuanced, complex characters but others are
        often simplified to good or bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the most important thing is not to constantly try and reframe
        everything as a strength, but rather to decide whether our friend,
        family, or lover's strength-weakness pairs are cumulatively "enough".
        Making a conscious decision about the strengths we love so that when
        they manifest as weaknesses, we can remind ourselves of why we put up
        with them in the first place.
