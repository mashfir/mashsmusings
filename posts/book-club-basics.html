        As a painfully honest joke in consulting went, "Do something once and
        you're sold as a practitioner, do something twice and you're sold as an
        expert." Recently, I became an expert in book clubs. Based on that
        expertise and extensive market research (discussions with friends), I am
        here to publish some best practices on how to conduct your own book
        club.
      </p>
      <ul id="book-club-tips">
        <li>
          Align on objectives. Is your book club merely a pretense for wine
          night with the girls? A way to affect social change? Or to
          <s
            >rip through classics well over your reading level to flex on
            peers</s
          >
          steep yourself in literary history? All of these reasons are
          separately valid but I would advise against putting a wannabe
          philosopher-king in a room with Karen from work looking to unwind on a
          Saturday night.
        </li>
        <li>
          Decide on a pace and stick to it. This is what separates being in a
          book club from telling your friends that you're in a book club. Think
          about how much time you would normally spend reading in a week and
          assume maybe half of that will go into your book club. It's easy to
          get overly ambitious here, nobody really wants to raise their hand as
          the slow reader. But trust me, everyone going at the same pace is much
          better than showing up with a handful of excuses and some extra wine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that you <em>could</em> have a political discussion with the
          members. Whether you're reading
          <em>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</em> or <em>Das Kapital</em>, the
          discussion will inevitably veer towards life and society. If you can't
          have open contentious discussion with these people, your book club
          probably won't end well. The biggest trap here is not necessarily
          having different political views but not viewing someone else as an
          intellectual equal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Choose the right book. This seems obvious and should follow from the
          objectives but this crucial step can feel like a UN General Assembly.
          If there's not a clear book that inspired the idea in the first place,
          start with a general theme, find a general time period, and go from
          there. When in doubt, <em>don't</em> go for
