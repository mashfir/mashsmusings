        However many times this question has come up, the universal answer I
        hear is "No". Perhaps this is a reflection of my circle or my
        environment? Maybe I'm surrounded by people working in low-wage service
        jobs or perhaps I'm in a country with a relatively low standard of
        living? Alas no, this is the response from yuppies in their mid-20s
        mostly earning more than $100k/year in two of the richest countries in
        the world. Ironically, many of these people today would exceed the
        definition of rich <em>they themselves</em> had given only a couple
        years prior. Today, that old definition seems irrelevant and any new
        definition is left vague.
      </p>
      <p>
        We often snidely refer to rich people as the 1% and yet in my experience
        the
        <a

          ><em>actual</em></a

        1% and 2% sheepishly deny such classification, instead choosing to self
        identify as "middle class". People are notoriously comparative
        creatures, especially when it comes to money, but it seems that 98th
        percentile income in a 90th percentile
        <a

        is still insufficient to self-identify as rich. While this is a genuine
        puzzle to me, I have a few rough thoughts as to why this might be the
        case:
      </p>
      <ul id="rich-excuses">
        <li>
          Having worries or fears about money and thinking that to be
          incompatible with being rich.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not meeting up to previous generations' benchmarks of wealth.
          Foremost, buying a detached home in the city.
        </li>
        <li>
          Comparing against only those richer than you when defining who is
          rich. Given how wealth is Pareto distributed, it's easy to find
          someone making 10x or 100x more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Guilt about one's own
          <a href="/posts/parabola-of-generosity.html" target="_blank"
            >lack of generosity</a
          >
          relative to what one expects of the rich.
        </li>
        <li>
          Having a feeling that there's not much left over at the end of the
          month.
        </li>
        <li>
          General social taboo to identify as rich. I still hear "no" in
          intimate one-on-one conversations so I don't think this is it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I don't purport to know why most people feel this way, perhaps they
        don't know themselves. But what I do know is that by any reasonable
        measure, they are rich, at least in a financial sense. If you answered
        "no" to this question, I would ask you to consider why and whether that
        is really true, and what being "rich" really looks like?
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up, I remember at some point asking my dad if we were rich; it
        seemed like everyone at school lived more luxuriously than us and my mom
        would often rebuke my asks with a sharp, "We don't have enough money."
        But I was confused because we had recently moved to a big new house, a
        big improvement over the old roach-infested apartment, and gotten a
        shiny new minivan[0], a godsend at the time for my rapidly growing
        frame. My dad gave me a nonresponse citing that it's not important, much
        to my frustration. I had wanted to feel superior to the other kids.
        Everyone else looked happier than me, and I had desperately wanted
        affirmation that there would be a payoff for this repressive upbringing
        and angst&mdash;that I'd have the last laugh in the end because this is
        how you got rich. What my dad got right was that I was asking for the
        wrong reasons. But what he failed to impress upon me were the right
        reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason to ask this question to ourselves is not to gain a sense of
        superiority over others or breed guilt within ourselves, but to bound
        the empty pursuit of money and seek real happiness. It is far easier to
        want more than it is to decide what is enough. And until we truly
        believe we have enough, we can never find peace.
