        <li>
          Not comingling with the other sex. It's the 21st century, you're not a
          bigot/misogynist/sexist. Definitely an anti-value.
        </li>
        <li>
          Being homophobic. Still living in the 21st century, you're not a
          bigot/homophobe. You're maybe not <em>really</em> totally 110%
          comfortable with it but let's not dwell on that. Probably an
          anti-value.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wearing recommended clothing. "Woah, are you backwards or repressed?"
          Maybe an anti-value.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not watching porn or masturbating. Nobody has ever talked about this
          out loud so maybe it's not even technically illegal. Let's say
          decriminalized if it's less than twice a day. You're secretly hopeful
          that incognito mode protects you from employers and omnipotent beings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Understanding the Qu'ran. You've read the whole Qu'ran, maybe even
          more than once. Of course, to keep its integrity, you read it in
          Arabic. Unfortunately, you don't speak a word of Arabic and reading it
          in English never occurred to you.
        </li>
        <li>Reading the Qu'ran. See above.</li>
        <li>
          Praying. Recommended but optional. Kind of like the extra non-graded
          assignments your teachers recommended; yeah you should be doing them
          but nobody else is doing them and you'll probably still pass.
        </li>
        <li>
          Giving zakat. You'll definitely do this when you have the money,
          that's just not yet. And you're pretty sure your dad's still paying
          for your entry on the holy ledger so you're probably fine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not having sex before marriage. What does this even really mean?
          Anything but PIV is fine, right? Maybe you've crossed that line too
          but what does it really matter if you're <em>planning</em> on getting
          married to this person? And even if you're not planning on marrying
          this person, what does it really matter if you're planning on getting
          married to some person at some point?
        </li>
        <li>
          Not drinking or taking drugs. You're not really gonna try to justify
          this one but hey, nobody's perfect. People need to loosen up a little.
          Maybe this is only for specal occasions... Which occur two to four
          times a week.
        </li>
        <li>
          Observing Ramadan. Super important time to make up for all your other
          slippages. Double down here and you buy yourself another year of
          mistakes, right? But exceptions are required. An actual quote from the
          past week, "I know it's Ramadan but I'm still definitely down for
          tomorrow night. I have been <em>needing</em> to get fucked up."
        </li>
        <li>
          Not eating pork. The most sacred aspect of faith, never to be
          questioned and never to be broken. This is your hill to die on. Having
          beers with your friends and they're about to order pepperoni pizza? "I
          can't, I'm Muslim."
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Don't take this too seriously in case I got your order wrong. Just some
        funny observations from decades spent growing up around people trying to
        reconcile identity, faith, and life in North America.
