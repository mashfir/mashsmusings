      <p>
        Last night I dreamt I was in a competition to build large scale art
        exhibits. As with all dreams, I have no idea how I got there, I
        certainly am not a top pick for such an exercise. Fortunately for me, my
        team seemed completely unfazed by my ineptitude and methodically built
        up a wondrous room-sized display of wood and metal. Sheets of metal were
        punched out and cut down to resemble ivy and the wood gave a sense of
        all of this simply being a part of nature. As with all dreams, I cannot
        quite put into words the details. What I remember clearly is a sense of
        awe at the whole thing. Somehow these people envisioned and built this
        wondrous structure, a feat beyond me in my wildest dreams!... Oh wait.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wasn't this exactly within my imagination? While writing this, I can
        humbly tell you that I have no idea how I'd begin to replicate the
        endeavor. Yet, wasn't it my own mind that effortlessly created and
        constructed, however impossibly, the whole thing? How bizarre this sense
        of creativity is. And how subconciously it occurs. Our brains
        paradoxically create the impossible while disbelieving its ability to
        create. Are we really of two (or more) minds as some research shows? Or
        is this all part of some cohesive singular experience? My conclusion:
        dreams are weird man.
