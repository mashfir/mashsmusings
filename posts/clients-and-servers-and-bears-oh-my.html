        I recently read a funny

        on things learned way too late in life. While there are certainly no
        shortage of such things to share, I have found some of my biggest "woah"
        moments in the last few years to be in the world of computers. Being
        pretty new to the field and largely self-taught, I consistently have the
        bittersweet experience of noticing a glaring blindspot and the lightbulb
        moment once the gap is filled in.

        Understanding the whole client-server thing was one of these
        experiences. These concepts are thrown around in almost any slightly
        technical computing context but for most of my life I just slowly nodded
        my head along without really getting it. It wasn't until I heard someone
        describe a server as "someone else's computer" that it clicked for me.
        While that is a bit reductive, I think it's a helpful reminder as we
        think of the original analogy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine that you're hungry suburbanite and you're walking down a strip
        mall of restaurants, deciding whether you really want to hit Subway
        after that "Subway man" scandal or if you'd rather deal with the
        screaming children at Appleby's. As you, the <em>client</em>, are
        <em>browsing</em> you decide that Subway was in part responsible for
        Jared Fogle's actions and decide on Appleby's as your <em>host</em> of
        choice. You, the client, are met by the <em>server</em> who takes your
        order, and after some time, serves up your <em>request</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In computing this is why your web browser is often referred to as the
        client. As you browse a website, there is a host computer, or server,
        which brings you the files displayed on your computer. The internet is
        conceptually just the mode of communication between these computers.
        Cool, right?
      </p>
