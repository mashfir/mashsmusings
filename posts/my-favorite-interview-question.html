        Interviewer: So, what's your deal?

        Simple. Profound. And most importantly, unexpected. Those are the
        reasons why, of all the interview questions I've come across, this is my
        absolute favorite. For the record, I certainly don't think this is the
        <em>best</em> interview question (I still don't really know what signal
        this would provide about the competency of a software engineer) but this
        question has certainly lingered with me the most, and provided the basis
        of many interesting conversations.
      </p>

      <p>
        For context, this was only portion of a gauntlet of highly unorthodox
        interview questions a friend was recounting after a brutal on-site at
        Palantir in 2017. At the time, Palantir was not the r/wallstreetbets
        meme stock it has become, but instead a mysterious shadowy organization
        that seemed to be on the cutting edge of applied machine learning and
        Big Brother conspiracies. And it seemed that this mysterious
        organization had a touch of Kantian humor in its interview process.

        The elegance of this seemingly farcical question is the inability to
        take it at face value. There is no obvious answer, no rehearsed

          >STAR</a
        >-format story you can regurgitate, no way to pander to what you think
        the interviewer might want to hear. Given the force of such a question,
        the conversation is likely to continue as it did with my friend:
      </p>

      <blockquote id="followup-conversation">
        Friend: Uhh... What?
        <br />
        Interviewer: Assume I've read everything on your resume so don't bother
        covering any of that. What's your deal?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        With your attempt to get some clarity foiled and your hope that there
        was a misunderstanding crushed, you're left again with the looming
        question: <em>"What's your deal?"</em> For most people, I think the
        interview ends there. This is not a question that many people have ever
        considered for themselves and not one they are equipped to tackle in the
        stress of an interview. I suspect the first part of this interview is
        simply to assess whether the candidate can even muster any sort of
        self-reflective response, regardless of what the answer may be.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the rest, this question hits an existential nerve. Why are you
        sitting in this interview room in the first place? And what are you
        hoping to get out of it, out of <em>life</em>? And how can you possibly
        try and capture this in a few minutes?
      </p>

      <p>
        I have thought about this question many times over the years and still
        find it fascinating. It comes to me every time I find myself questioning
        the meaning of work or the fulfillment derived from it. This post is not
        about my answer, I'll save that for another day or an in-person
        conversation &mdash; this post is to make you consider this question for
        yourself. After all, if we can't answer a question so simple, then what
        is our deal?
