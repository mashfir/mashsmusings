        One of the first barriers I ran into was in step 3, trying to wrap my
        head around window functions. Fortunately there are

        that provide in-depth explanations of how window functions work which
        certainly helped me in getting to step 3 and step 6. But I want to focus
        on perhaps a more important aspect of getting to step 3: when should I
        even use window functions? What types of problems will they help solve?
      </p>
      <p>
        Fundamentally, when thinking through any SQL problem, one must think in
        terms of records. What information does each record in the table
        represent? Do I only care about certain records? Time to think of the
        <code>WHERE</code>. Do I need records from a different table?
        <code>FROM</code> clause. Do I care about records in aggregate?
        <code>GROUP BY</code> clause. Do I only care about specific groups?
        <code>HAVING</code> clause. The vast majority of the time, this basic
        syntax will get me what I need. By thinking very carefully about what I
        want to happen to 3 or 4 records, I can get a sense of the shape of my
        final query.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, sometimes when breaking down a problem, I run into a roadblock:
        what if I need information from some other records to compute
        information about <em>this</em> record? For example, let's say I have
        daily records of the weather, what if I want to compare today's record
        against yesterday's record? Running through the list of basic SQL
        clauses, I realize that none of them quite solve this problem. Enter
        window functions.

          >The biggest clue to use window functions is when you need to pull
          information from other records, into this record.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay... Well when is that? Since that statement is a little opaque,
        let's think of a couple examples and break down how they fit the
        criteria.
      </p>
      <ul id="window-examples">
        <li>
          Calculating day-over-day change: To compute day-over-day change, I
          need to compare the record at time <var>t</var> with the record at
          time <var>t-1</var>. After a bit of searching, I find that the window
          function I need is <code>lag(temp) OVER(ORDER BY day)</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Calculating 7-day trailing average: Initially this seems like I want
          to <code>GROUP BY</code> week. But when I break down the problem in
          terms of records, I realize that what I'm actually trying to do is for
          time <var>t</var>, take the average of the previous six records,
          <var>t-6</var>, and this record <var>t</var>. After some searching and
          trial and error, I find that I need to
          <code>avg(temp) OVER(ORDER BY day ROWS 6 PRECEDING)</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Calculating percent total: Let's say I have a table containing how
          many steps I've taken by day and I want to figure out what percentage
          of the total amount of steps each day represents. To do that, I need
          to compare the record at time <var>t</var> to <em>all</em> the other
          records across time <var>0</var> to time <var>infinity</var>. In this
          case, I would need to <code>sum(steps) OVER()</code> the other records
          to get my denominator.
        </li>
        <li>
          Calculating running total: Now I want to know how many steps I've
          taken for the entire year. Doing that means that for time
          <var>t</var>, I need to grab all the records from <var>t=0</var> upto
          time <var>t</var>. Some more searching would tell me that I need to
          <code>sum(steps) OVER(ORDER BY day)</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hopefully these examples give you a better picture of when window
        functions are the right tool to use. They may not be something you use
        everyday but when you inevitably run into this inter-record problem
        space, they really make your life easier. As a fun aside, know that all
        window functions could be replaced by a single CTE and join, which is
        how these inter-record problems were solved up until recently. Once you
        start to feel a solid footing on step 3, try replacing your window
        functions with joins to start the climb to step 4.
