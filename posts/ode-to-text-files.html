Where have gone our beautiful text files?
The simple markdown or markup
Or the endangered .txt?

Think not of Microsoft Word docs
Save that for the businessmen and uninitiated.

Think not of Adobe PDFs
Save that for the lawyers and publishers.

Forget Apple Notes and Google Keep
Who imprison words within their walls.

A good text file is like good peanut butter,
it should contain only a single ingredient.

If Notepad can't read it then neither will I.
Bring back the beautiful text file.
