        On a podcast some years ago, I came across a simple yet powerful litmus
        test to decide which side of a complicated conflict lines up with my
        personal values. Imagine if one side had complete and total power, what
        are <em>they</em> saying they'd do with that power? If the answer
        appalls you, problem solved.

        Obviously, things are not always so simple. A party may outwardly state
        one objective but secretly have another. But, at least in the case of
        international conflict, you'll be surprised at how often a group's
        publicly stated mission goes completely against your beliefs.
