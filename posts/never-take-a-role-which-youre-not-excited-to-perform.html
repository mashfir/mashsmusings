        This advice can be broken down into roughly three imperatives that all
        try to capture the same thing. First, don't apply to roles that don't
        excite you. Early on, when you're still trying to figure out what it is
        you want to do and what jobs are out there, this will seem impossible.
        The best way to combat this is to take advantage of the infectiousness
        of excitement; for roles that you <em>think</em> you are interested in
        or roles that you are eligible for, try talking to at least one person
        in that role. The more similar this person is to you, the more
        infectious their excitement will be. If you're in school, try to find a
        recent graduate. If you're coming from an atypical background, try to
        find someone with a similar background or just some other atypical
        background. Your goal is to get a sense of what excites this person
        about the role and see if that, in turn, excites you. If you're still
        not excited, consider a new field of work.
      </p>
      <p>
        If nothing seems appealing, as is often the case, step back to think
        about which activities most easily drop you into a sense of focus or
        "flow", that feeling where you are totally committed to working on
        something, where stress and a sense of time kind of fall away to a sense
        of alertness. Don't confuse this with having fun or feeling joy, you're
        unlikely to find a sense of flow hanging out with friends or watching
        TV. Again resolve to try and talk to someone making a living doing that
        thing to see if that excites you. Eventually you'll find something that
        excites you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, don't sacrifice excitement about the current role for the
        prospect of a future role, this is one of the most surefire paths to
        misery. The characteristic thought pattern here is something along the
        lines of, "Yeah, this isn't really my top choice but I think it's fine
        and in 2 years, I should be able to pivot to X." Taking a role under
        this pretense sets you up for a lot of anxiety around performance with
        none of the intrinsic motivation required to perform at your best.
        Starting down this path is a slippery slope as 2 years down the line you
        will find yourself making the same choice, and 2 years after that,
        making it again. Each sacrifice for the future compounding your misery
        in the present. Focus on the present and let the future come to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, really bask in the sense of gratitude and accomplishment that
        comes from receiving an offer. Let yourself be excited, don't trivialize
        the achievement. Too often, we whittle away that sense of excitement by
        immediately considering downsides, weighing the next moves before we've
        taken this one. Even a brief moment to breathe a sigh of relief and
        internally celebrate the accomplishment can have a profound effect. Be
        grateful, be excited! You've earned it. Sometimes, it can be enough to
        just be excited about landing <em>a</em> job. For the entire year
        between accepting a job in consulting and starting, I remember having a
        great sense of excitement, perhaps mostly driven by a sense of relief. I
        would often get questions I thought completely irrelevant such as, "What
        does one do in consulting?" or, "What are you consulting for?" Of course
        I hadn't the faintest clue to the answers but boy was I excited.
