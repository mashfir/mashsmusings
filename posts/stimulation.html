        I wake up and grab my phone&mdash;it's 7:30 a.m., Friday. I feel a
        little groggy, definitely went to bed a little too late last night in a
        YouTube blackhole about homes I will never be able to afford. Oops. I
        really don't feel like working today but at least the weekend is almost
        here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I quickly check up on my messages: a brief skim through texts,
        Messenger, Instagram, Signal, and WhatsApp. I'm a little disappointed, I
        for some reason expected&mdash;hoped for more. I don't have time to
        respond to what's there but fire off a few quick reactjis to the best
        ones. I'll get to it later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Up next, email inboxes. It's too early for work emails though. Nothing
        but the usual junk, some spammy newsletters, bank updates, and sales
        codes I was expecting. I'll save the news articles for later, not really
        feeling it right now. I really should get around to unsubscribing from
        these one of these days... Select all, delete. Back to inbox zero,
        already starting the day with some progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really should get out of bed but let's just quickly check-in on my
        favorite subreddits. LOL couple good posts. Quick check of the homepage.
        LOL the internet is amazing. Nothing great past page 3 though, the
        upvotes got it right. A quicker tour through Instagram, tossing a single
        heart, I see that there's nothing great.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shit, time to actually get up. Tune into my favorite podcast while I get
        ready for the day and check up those news articles in my inbox. Shit is
        crazy these days, I can't believe this is where we're at. Hop back into
        my audiobook while I start brewing coffee. God, that smells good. I
        didn't realize my head was aching but it's already dying down before the
        coffee is ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pop open my meditation app for a quick session to start the day off.
        Much better. Halfway through the cup and I'm feeling human again. Time
        to hop onto the first Zoom call of the day: "Hey team!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Glad that's over with. Ugh let's check in on the work emails... "53 new
        messages". Great. I'll just check Slack first before really digging
        through this. Agh, a few requests I missed last night. Let me just do
        them right now before I forget. Done. And I'll mark everything else as
        unread so I don't forget to come back to it later (I hope). Time to
        tackle that inbox again. 45 minutes later and done. Back to inbox zero.
        Do I really need to work the rest of the day? This seems like a lot for
        a Friday.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jk, I wish. Now it's time to actually get some stuff done. My morning
        podcast won't do, this is going to require my work playlist on Spotify.
        Plugged back into the headphones <em>aaaaand we're off</em>. I drop back
        into the messaging apps a few times when I have a second to write out my
        responses and see what friends have to say. Respond to a couple more
        pings as well and hop into another call. I cannot seem to focus, TGIF.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally lunch time. Pop open last night's UberEats into the microwave
        while browsing YouTube for something to watch and checking up my
        messages. Gotta find something "educational" of course, it's still work
        hours. New episode of Last Week Tonight? Sweet. Food is ready, and we're
        good to go. Go through a couple more episodes while I'm putting in the
        dishes. Shit, next call is in a few minutes. 2x through the rest of the
        video and <em>just</em> squeeze into the call. Nailed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I quickly check up on my messages again after the call, no responses
        though. Back to the playlist to hammer out the rest of the afternoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        TGIF! Did I say that already? Don't have much planned (thanks #COVID)
        but relieved nontheless. I'll go out for a quick walk and workout.
        Should I tune back in the podcast? Queue up my workout playlist? Or
        maybe call someone? Nah, too tired for a call. Let's go with the
        podcast. I'll hit the playlist when I start the workout.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back to cook up some dinner. Quickly 2x through the recipe video again
        just to make sure I'm not forgetting anything and turn on a couple funny
        videos in the meantime. Food is ready, can't wait to enjoy it. But what
        do I watch with dinner? I know, I'll catch up on that latest Netflix
        series.
      </p>
      <p>
        Work finished. Workout completed. Dinner cooked. Sucks that I can't hang
        out with friends (#COVID) but at least I have some time to finally
        unwind and decompress. What to watch? Don't have the energy for a movie
        or something heavy. I turn to my current comedy pick, satirical and
        topical, just what I need. Hit play, grab my phone, and catch up with
        friends in the meantime.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's getting late, time to start getting ready for bed. Plug back into
        my audiobook while going through the nightly routine. At least not going
        out means I can catch up on sleep. I get into bed but I'm not
        <em>quite</em> asleep yet so I just quickly catch up on messages again.
        Nothing else good on Reddit or Insta. I'll just take a quick peek at
        TikTok before passing out. LOL the internet is amazing. Did I say that
        already? It's 1:00 am!? Fuck. Not again.

        We drown ourselves in stimulation, deeply uncomfortable and evasive of
        the most fleeting moments of boredom. And yet we say we are not
        addicted, there is no problem. Try eating your next meal devoid of any
        sort of tech, enjoy it slowly and deliberately, maybe over 20 minutes.
        Why is it so hard to savor a moment like this? Why do we want more? Are
        we not addicted?
