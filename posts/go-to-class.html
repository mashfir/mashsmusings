        One of my top regrets in life is my abysmal class attendance in
        university. I'd imagine a plot of my class attendance vs time would look
        almost like a perfectly straight line from 100% in the first few months
        of freshman year to 20% in the final months of senior year. The regret
        does not stem from the lost GPA but rather the lost learning. I can
        already see my younger self rolling his eyes and mentally checking out.
        And as this is a directive for that younger self, this seems like a lost
        cause. But bear with me, since I think there is something that younger
        me missed.

        Going to class is the best way to passively learn and collect extra GPA.
        Like reading, going to class gets built up as this great virtuous
        activity; one that requires the utmost attention, pre-reads, furious
        note-taking, and questions that are 9 parts flexing your understanding
        to classmates to 1 part real question. And yes, those will all
        absolutely enrich the experience, especially the flexing.. But the
        beauty of class is that you still gain something with absolutely none of
        that.

        As mentioned in Mortimer J. Adler's condescendingly yet aptly-named
        <em>How to Read a Book</em>, it's important to get the gist of a book
        before really analyzing it. On the first pass, focus on what you do
        understand, instead of what you don't. This seemingly simple advice
        contradicts most of schooling where you can't progress until you
        understand. And I think this simple shift in focus, away from frantic
        dictation to a laidback absorption of occasional insight, is what's
        missed. The rest can (but probably won't) come later. Take the freebies
        while you can. Go to class. Don't worry about notes or what you miss.
        Just show up.
