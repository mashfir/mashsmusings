        In Oct. 2020, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took a
        <a

          target="_blank"
          >divisive stance</a
        >
        on keeping politics out of the workplace. Sparked by employee walkouts
        in reaction to Armstrong's reluctance to publicly comment on the BLM
        movement, this stance was cemented in the wake of heated political
        discussions preceding the Nov. 2020 US Presidential elections. In Apr.
        2021, Basecamp founders
        <a

          target="_blank"

        and
        <a
          href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/basecamp-s-new-etiquette-regarding-societal-politics-at-work-b44bef69"
          >DHH</a

        followed suit, stating that there were to be no more societal or
        political discussions in workplace channels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both companies issued the statements alongside generous severance
        packages ranging from three to six months' pay and benefits. In the
        aftermath, Coinbase lost 60 employees, representing 5% of its workforce,
        and Basecamp lost 20 employees, representing a staggering
        <em>35%</em> of its workforce.
      </p>
      <p>
        While long backstories are needed to examine those as case studies
        (along with a sense of base rate attrition from such a severance policy
        alone), this got me interested in the philosophical idea of what role
        politics ought to play at work. If every company had to issue a "Yea or
        nay?" directive tomorrow regarding politics in work platforms, what
        should they do?

        From the employee side, I get that people want to work somewhere that
        reflects their values. I would certainly be reluctant to take a
        comparable at a payday loan provider or tobacco producer. For many
        people, this reflection of values extends to working somewhere that
        represents their political views. Identity at work, especially for
        millenials seems to have moved from "What are we creating?" to "What do
        we stand for?". The fusion of these has led to confusing wonders such as
        Ben & Jerry's

        more than I bargained for with my soft serve and sprinkles.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my experience, I have had positive political experiences at work
        which involved listening to people from specific groups share their
        personal experiences and concerns on a relevant topic. Given the size
        and absolute diversity of the workplace, I gained a perspective wholly
        unavailable to me given my friend group outside of work. However, these
        sessions involve sharing of exclusively mainstream left-wing views which
        are from unanimous and I am confident that these public sharing sessions
        would not be so well-received if they were right-wing, which hints at
        the heart of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        What people really want with politics in the workplace, as evidenced by
        the walkouts in 2020, is a place to share their political views and have
        them affirmed by leadership. Opposing views are loudly decried and end
        up triggering many. Sharing political views on a podium, at work or
        elsewhere, does not permit for safe rebuttal or dissent. Speaking to an
        audience of more than a couple of people quickly triggers the identity
        and posturing part of our brains and pushback is perceived as a threat
        to be neutralized. Somebody must win the public opinion. What was once a
        place to work together on creating a specific value to society quickly
        devolves into another shouting match.
      </p>
      <p>
        What really changes hearts and minds are individualized, intimate
        conversations. People often say that you ought not to talk about
        religion or politics at work but I disagree. In a one-on-one setting,
        especially at work, it's much easier to know that we're on the same
        team. We can argue about the whole world, move on positions without
        losing face, and grab a drink afterwards, closer than we were before.
        Things get hairy when you move to talking about politics at work
        <em>at scale</em>. So to all the CEOs mulling over tomorrow's big "Yea
        or nay?", vote "Nay". Leave the office as a place to drive specific
        value and unify anyone interested in that mission; let the politics
        follow from that unity and not divide it.
