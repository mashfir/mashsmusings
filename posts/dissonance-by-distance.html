        I was recently chatting with a coworker about personal ambitions and
        interests. She wanted to explore building a startup and I wanted to
        meditate on life and catch up on a quarter century of not reading
        enough. The first step of both? Quitting our current jobs. We both had
        an easy time encouraging each other's goals and downplaying the
        perceived risk but as similar as our goals were, the calculus seemed to
        change when evaluating our own situations. My coworker captured the
        irony perfectly, "I can tell you that <em>your</em> fears are irrational
        but when I apply those fears to <em>me</em>, they seem completely
        rational."

        It is strange to ponder how true this really is. When listening to
        someone else's woes or concerns, it seems all too obvious what the
        solution is or how culpable the friend is for their own suffering. When
        pausing to reflect on how it feels to <em>be</em> in their shoes, it's
        never so simple. Thinking about things from my perspective, at a
        psychological distance of zero, there is some strong dissonance about
        what facts are relevant or important but as that psychological distance
        increases, that dissonance quickly drops to zero.

        When looking in as an outsider, we are able to take achieve a sense of
        clarity through simplification. All of our personal decision-making is
        enmeshed in decades of habits, social norms, anxieties, and rules but
        outside of ourselves; situations are boiled down to a handful of facts
        and decisions are clear. The complicated mess of emotions and feelings
        disappears and decisions become a matter of connecting the dots.
        Emotions and fears become fuzzy layers confusing the facts as opposed to
        valid reasons to consider the facts differently than they are. With my
        coworker, we were both able to look at each other's situations, assess
        that the actual potential downside is fairly limited, and the gain in
        wellbeing extremely high, but when viewed through our own lens, that
        jump into the shallow end stretches into an Olympic dive.

        This relationship seems to hold true in even trivial situations, as I
        discovered in the middle of a game of chess. After thinking through a
        few ideas to try and push my advantage in the mid-game, I decided to
        bring my queen closer to the quickly growing kingside attack. The move
        seemed strong but I was aware of a lot of weaknesses in my position and
        key squares I didn't control. To my surprise, my friend spectating the
        match quickly calls out "Mate in 3." Turns out he was right. We
        discussed afterwards how much easier it is to notice these things as a
        spectator. Even though we were seeing the same board, the mere fact of
        having some psychological distance afforded him greater clarity. Even in
        a game of chess, we are so caught up in our fears and worries that we
        miss the obvious.

        Unfortunately, getting rid of an egocentric world view is not an easy
        task which leaves me with two takeaways. The first is to remember this
        outsider perspective we have when listening to others, increasing our
        empathy for what it truly feels like to be that person. The second is to
        achieve nirvana, lose this narrow sense of self, and detach from our ego
        altogether. But in the meantime, I do the next best thing: ask a friend.
