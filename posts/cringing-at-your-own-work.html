        At a recent talk at work, the speaker off-handedly mentioned something
        that stuck with me:
      </p>
      <blockquote id="looking-back">
        If I don't look back at my work a year from now and think it was crap,
        then I should probably be in management.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This guy is currently an individual contributor (IC) but had spent
        enough time as an engineering manager that this comment was not entirely
        tongue-in-cheek. The idea is that ICs should be improving themselves
        sufficiently to question previous work. In my conversations with other
        ICs, I have found this to be almost universally true. The more ambitious
        the person, the more crap things look in hindsight!
      </p>
      <p>
        I first noticed this almost exactly a year after starting full-time
        work. From slides to presentation style to spreadsheets, I cringed at
        almost everything I had put out. One year later and that still held
        true. Whether it's in the approach taken or simply the speed of
        execution, the glances in the rearview mirror continue to be ugly.
        Progress is a funny thing.

        Now in some ways this might seem obvious. Absolute improvement in a
        given domain probably follows an S-curve and if you're working across
        different domains, you're almost guaranteed to be in the exponential
        section of at least one of those S-curves. Despite knowing that in the
        abstract, it's hard to feel detached from your current work
        <em>right now</em>. Even if I hope to look back and pick apart all the
        ways in which my work was crap, I would be absolutely devastated to have
        someone else say that to me at this moment. Our egos cannot take the
        criticism in the same way until we've achieved some distance from work
        and become more confident in who we are.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, thinking about this in the abstract helps feel at least a
        little bit better about critical feedback for my current work. And if
        that stops being true then hopefully you're reading the musings of your
        future boss.
