        For most people, the idea of developing technical skills fills them with
        a sense of dread. As a new grad with no practical hard skills, I
        honestly had no sense of what value I could offer. Up until a few years
        ago, the thought of a terminal would immediately fill me with a sense of
        panic that I'd break something, terminals were for "hackers" and I
        certainly was not a 1337 h4x0r. But having dispelled a lot of those
        fears, my advice now is to lean into developing technical skills when
        possible. After all, if you're using a tool for 8 hours or more a day,
        you want to make sure you get the most out of it. In today's age, there
        is almost no upper limit to how many times more effective you can be by
        developing these skills.

        Start by diving deeper into the tools you use everyday. If you're in
        consulting, learn everything you can about PowerPoint, understand how a
        pro would use the tool. If you're in finance, become a true expert in
        Excel. How does a pivot table really work? How should you be structuring
        your data knowing that? You might already be able to accomplish what you
        need to do day-to-day but after you finish some task, at least mentally
        challenge yourself to do it in half the time, or at least half the
        keystrokes. Learning new skills like how to train a neural net for the
        sake of it can be fun and temporarily motivating but the skills quickly
        disappear without a good use. Gaining mastery of your existing tools on
        the other hand turns you into an everyday superhero and lays the
        foundation for future learnings[0]. You'll know you're on the right
        track if you find yourself

        >.

        When trying to learn more typical coding skills, apply a similar
        pattern: start by automating things you are already doing to make things
        less of a grind. If you're on macOS, open up Terminal and start learning
        the basics of Unix/bash, if you're on Windows, start with PowerShell.
        While moving files, creating directories, and renaming things doesn't
        sound sexy, these are the basics that you will <em>actually</em> benefit
        from while learning.

        At some point, you may realize that getting more technical stops being
        interesting and feels like a bad use of time; perhaps you want to go
        into management or more business-focused. Just be aware that there is an
        asymmetry: it will be a lot easier to go less technical than it will be
        to go more technical, a fact which I can personally attest to. Having a
        bias, however small, towards going more technical will help you avoid
        getting the point where you can no longer really "do" and can only
        manage. As long as you focus on what's useful to you, the investment
        will pay off long into the future. "Computers are the bicycle of the
        mind," as Steve Jobs famously said, so time to get riding.
