      <p>
        These days I find myself receiving more frequent requests for career
        advice. A part of me is excited to share the wisdom that
        <a
          href="https://mashsmusings.neocities.org/posts/directives-for-a-younger-self.html"
          target="_blank"
          >I wish I knew</a
        >
        at a younger age. But a part of me also feels like I'm not in a position
        to give advice, that I have somehow ended up where I am through a series
        of Indiana Jones temple escapes, <em>juuust</em> making it to the next
        step by the skin of my teeth or as a friend eloquently put it: stumbling
        upwards. On the cusp of another career move, I think it's time to reckon
        with this in a series of posts on my journey and advice I would give.
      </p>
      <p>
        After wracking my brain for advice that would apply to everyone, I
        realized that this would inevitably please no one. Career decisions are
        inherently personal and for career advice to resonate, there needs to be
        a personal connection. So what follows will be a very personal
        recollection of my journey and the specific advice I would give to
        people interested in going down a generally similar path. It's up to you
        to decide how much is meaningful to you.

      <h2>My career journey</h2>
      <p>
        It is really easy to rewrite history and make your career path sound
        almost inevitable given your wit, grit, and charisma. In panel
        discussions or interviews, you'll hear interviewees recite well-crafted
        origin stories where their determination or ingenuity kept pushing them
        through every step. For me the journey has certainly <em>not</em> felt
        like that. To give you a sense of what it has felt like, I've documented
        my career moves by age and what I think were the most import factors in
        landing that job. Though do note that after age 19,
        <strong
          >the single biggest factor was the accumulation of past
          experiences.</strong
        >
        I have ommitted belaboring this point to avoid repetition, not for lack
        of significance.

        <li>18: blind luck, maybe high GPA</li>
        <li>19: nepotism, maybe moderate GPA</li>
        <li>20: lucky timing, moderately high GPA</li>
        <li>21: moderately high GPA, interview prep, memorable questions</li>
        <li>24: networking, referral, interview gaming</li>
        <li>
          25: unusually aligned experience, referral, love-fueled determination,
          interview prep

      </ol>
      <p>
        If you're young and this seems woefully unimpressive, that's good. Most
        outwardly successful people I know have similarly unheroic backstories.
        The lesson here is that though things may seem tough early on,
        compounding experience and skills will lessen the role of luck over
        time. Regardless of what age you're at now, realize that the first
        couple breaks will not be glamorous and things will feel
        impossible&mdash;push through, things will get better.
