        We take it for granted that our ability to see colors and hear pitch
        make our lives richer. We would lament the loss of our ability to see
        the color green or our ability to hear a clear C; trees would lose their
        majesty and songs their beat. Yet we willingly deny ourselves the
        opportunity to cry. "Men don't cry" the saying goes and with it goes a
        corresponding richness of experience.

        For the majority of my adolescence, I cried only in the most extreme
        situations of stress. In my suburban upbringing, this was fortunately
        tantamount to girl troubles and feelings of loneliness. After my
        freshman year in university, my zone of tears started to expand to the
        occasional movie. If you don't shed a tear at Robin Williams's
        recollection of holding his dying friend on the battlefield and watching
        his wife wither away from cancer in <em>Good Will Hunting</em>, you are
        some kind of monster. While small, this departure from crying from
        personal stress to crying for something beyond me
        <em>felt</em> different, like something new had been unlocked. While I
        would experience these empathic tears more fully on some subsequent MDMA
        trips, I still could not shake the embarrassment that followed every
        episode, that I had transgressed some tenet of manhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        That changed almost overnight after my unexpected
        <a href="/posts/develop-empathy.html" target="_blank"
          >empathy training</a
        >. I found myself brought to tears by the book I was reading at the
        time, <em>Flowers for Algernon</em>. I didn't make anything of it at the
        time, if you didn't cry reading the last few journal entries, you are
        some kind of monster. But then it happened again with another book. And
        another one. And then by a new song I had listened to. And then again...
        Now keep in mind that this was not some sort of mental breakdown where I
        was crying everyday but this certainly felt like a departure from the
        handful of times I had cried in the past <em>decade</em>.

        I didn't feel any weaker than before. Emotionally speaking, I felt more
        secure than I ever had in the past. No longer was crying a source of
        embarrassment or shame, but just a natural expression of really
        connecting with something &mdash; I was seeing a new color to which I
        was previously blind. Of course my old purposes were still served, I
        would go on to cry plenty about my upcoming girl troubles. But now I
        would also cry for troubles never faced: wars never experienced, loved
        ones not yet lost, valuable friendships still standing. What a color
        this was.

        If you're reading this and you're skeptical, I hear you. This is
        admittedly somewhat beyond the pale. But I would encourage you to think
        about the things in your life and reflect on their value. Consider that
        your next meal will be the last one you ever eat. Or that time hanging
        out with your friend will be the last time you see him. Or that last
        goodbye you said to a loving parent will truly be the last. Reflect that
        as far fetched as these may seem, one day they will all be true. If it
        is okay to shed tears to mourn their loss tomorrow, then it must be okay
        to shed tears to celebrate their existence today.
