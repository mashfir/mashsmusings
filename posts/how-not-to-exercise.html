      <p>
        We are often reminded these days to treat ourselves. Books and studies
        around habit forming will recommend positive reinforcement of good
        habits by rewarding yourself for each positive behavior. My newest bad
        habit shows that taking this mantra <em>too</em> seriously is like
        taking 2 steps forward and <em>n</em> steps back, where
        <em>n</em> represents a number which I don't want to think about. The
        initial objective was to explore the new cities I'd moved to and get
        myself out for some longer walks or bike rides. Fresh air and exercise,
        what could go wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
        To incentivize myself I set some destination point for some new treat,
        usually a donut or ice cream shop at least half an hour away, to act as
        a reward for accomplishing this goal. This worked to great effect and
        had me exploring all around nearby neighborhoods all for the cost of
        some spent calories. Unfortunately, it turns out that my brain's sugar
        response was a bit <em>too</em> powerful for this to be sustainable. I
        soon found my Pavlovian response kicking in every time I would leave the
        house for anything. Out for a grocery run? Hmm isn't there a donut shop
        a bit further down the road? Chatting with a friend on a walk? Oh, might
        as well grab some fro-yo.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an attempt to justify my behavior, I propose a thought experiment:
        Who is likely to live a "healthier" life? The man doing regular, intense
        exercise and crushing two scoops of ice cream and a decadent donut every
        day? Or the man living a relaxed life, never exceeding 60 bpm heart
        rate, with not a gram of sugar in his body? Let my tombstone show that I
        undertook these endeavors with all the gravitas associated with such a
        scientific endeavor, for who could argue that there were any other
        options left to take?
      </p>
