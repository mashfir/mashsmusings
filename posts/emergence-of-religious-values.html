        Over the last few years, fueled in part by curiosity and in part by the
        search for the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe,
        and Everything, I have tried implementing a variety of lifestyle
        changes. Most of these ideas have come from separate sources and some
        have stuck more than others (I swear I'll start working out everyday
        tomorrow). But taking a step back on some of the more impactful ones
        paints an eerily familiar picture:
      </p>
      <ol id="habits">
        <li>
          <em>Rarely drink or do drugs.</em> Inspired by my hatred of weekends
          spent recovering from hangovers and by examples set by two friends
          enjoying the same parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Abstain from porn and masturbation.</em> Inspired by that one
          <a href="https://vid.puffyan.us/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU" target="_blank"
            >TEDx Talk</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Meditate first thing in the morning and often before bed.</em>
          Inspired by Sam Harris.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Rarely eat meat.</em> Inspired by a course in air pollution
          engineering and a long-time partner.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Read philosophy and religious texts.</em> Inspired by desire to
          find the Answer and catch up on
          <a
            href="/posts/dont-read-what-others-are-reading.html"
            target="_blank"
            >literary tradition</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Rarely lie.</em> Inspired by Sam Harris and a long-time partner. I
          would say I never lie but...
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Tithe.</em> Inspired by a SEO savvy career quiz that led me to
          <a href="https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/" target="_blank"
            >80,000 Hours</a

          and
          <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org" target="_blank"
            >Giving What We Can</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Reduce amount of "stuff".</em> Inspired by anxiety around clutter
          and desire to save more.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Intermittently fast.</em> Inspired by David Sinclair's
          <em>Lifespan</em>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The clear religious bent of this list would outdo many Muslims I know.
        Yet my belief in a traditional God is no stronger than it was before. In
        fact I'd wager that the intense angst and atheist identity formed in my
        teenage years probably made me more resistant to these ideas than most.
        But here we are. Like the final zoom out on
        <a href="https://vid.puffyan.us/watch?v=IceiU-Wmnog" target="_blank"
          >Art Attack</a
        >, it is surprising how a series of small unrelated steps looks from a
        big picture lens.
      </p>

        Does this mean the seemingly arbitrary rules handed down by religions
        are really some emergent properties that arise from one's search for
        truth and contentment? If so, does that justify the use of more
        persuasive tools such as fear and shame to keep others on the path?
      </p>
      <p>
        While I leave you to ponder the former, I draw a hard line against the
        latter. It is easy, in hindsight, to preach about virtues, but applying
        pressure wantonly does more harm than good. For me, each of these habits
        came from the right conversation at the right time. And the only real
        teacher was lived experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        More insidiously, packaging virtues with negative emotions can backfire
        in a spectacular way. Discovered individually and independently, virtues
        serve as a rock solid foundation for identity; but handed down from God,
        the slightest tremor can cause the house of cards to topple into crisis.
        Inoculation means bottom-up learning. And bottom-up learning means
        making your own mistakes.
