        I recently read a funny
        <a
          href="https://amoderatelyattractivemind.wordpress.com/2022/08/01/things-i-learned-way-too-late-in-life/"

        on things learned way too late in life. While there are certainly no
        shortage of such things to share, I have found some of my biggest "woah"
        moments in the last few years to be in the world of computers. Being
        pretty new to the field and largely self-taught, I consistently have the
        bittersweet experience of noticing a glaring blindspot and the lightbulb
        moment once the gap is filled in.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of these unintuitive blind spots for me had to do with reading URLs.
        As an example, let's take the URL of this web page as an example:
      </p>
      <code>
        <pre>
https://mashsmusings.neocities.org/posts/how-to-read-a-url.html
	</pre
        >
      </code>

      <p>
        If you are at all literate in English, you tend to read from left to
        right. Thus, I would have interpreted the URL as, "Some mumbo-jumbo
        colon-slash-slash, then the mashsmusings site which has something to do
        with the org neocities, then reading a specific post within 'posts'."
        While the left-to-right heuristic is great 99% of time, it unfortunately
        doesn't work when reading your favorite waifu manga and, confusingly,
        only <em>mostly</em> works for reading URLs. To see what I mean, let's
        dig into the different components of our URL.
      </p>

      <code>
        <pre>
https://mashsmusings.neocities.org/posts/how-to-read-a-url.html
<------><------------------------><-----><-------------------->
   1                2                3             4

        >
      </code>

      <ol id="url-components">
        <li>
          <dfn>protocol</dfn>: This part is kind of complicated but, in short,
          this defines what set of instructions needs to be used to read the
          resource. This will almost always be Hypertext Transfer Protocol to
          read from web servers but sometimes you might run into something like
          "mailto:" which initiates an email message to a specific email
          address.
        </li>

        <li>
          <dfn>domain</dfn>: The domain can be thought of as the human-readable
          name of a server, AKA
          <a
            href="/posts/clients-and-servers-and-bears-oh-my.html"
            target="_blank"
            >someone else's computer</a
          >. Confusingly, domain names are interpreted in
          <em>reverse order</em> and in hierarchical fashion. So in our example,
          our top-level domain (TLD) is "org", "neocities" is a single subdomain
          under "org", and "mashsmusings" is a single subdomain under
          "neocities". This backwards-reading domain tells us which computer on
          the internet we're interacting with.
        </li>

        <li>
          <dfn>path name</dfn>: The series of folders you can imagine clicking
          through on the server's hard drive. In our example, this is the
          "/posts" directory under the root directory.
        </li>

        <li>
          <dfn>file name</dfn>: The name of the actual file you are requesting
          from the server in the directory specified by the path name
          beforehand, including the extension associated with that file. This is
          usually a ".html" file specifying a web page but sometimes it can be a
          <a
            href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/112/566/business.jpg"
            target="_blank"
            >.jpg</a
          >
          or
          <a
            href="https://ia804609.us.archive.org/4/items/rick-roll/Rick%20Roll.mp4"
            target="_blank"
            >.mp4</a
          >
          for an image or video clip respectively.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Putting this all together gives a more illuminating interpretation than
        the one prior. Now the same URL can be interpreted as "Using the HTTPS
        protocol, go to the server registered as 'mashsmusings', a subdomain of
        'neocities', a subdomain of 'org'; go to the posts folder, and get me
        the file called 'how-to-read-a-url.html'". Despite being an avid
        internet user since age 7, I never picked this up until I had to set up
        my own site &mdash; the more you know!
      </p>

      <p>
        As a side note, learning about domain hierarchies being read right to
        left, made me wonder why most sites have the terminal subdomain "www".
        Turns out, it's completely pointless! Having a "www" subdomain was a
        legacy convention to specifying that your server was on the Worldwide
        web but over time, that convention has fallen away in favor of clearer,
        more concise domain names. Not everything has a good reason.
