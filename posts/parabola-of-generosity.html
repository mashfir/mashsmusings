        I remember in my early trading days, at age twenty-five or so, when
        money started to become easy. I would take taxis, and if the driver
        spoke skeletal English and looked particularly depressed, I'd give him a
        $100 bill as a tip, just to give him a little jolt and get a kick out of
        his surprise. I'd watch him unfold the bill and look at it with some
        degree of consternation ($1 million would certainly have been better but
        it was not within my means). It was also a simple hedonic experiment: it
        felt elevating to make someone's day with the trifle of $100. I
        eventually stopped; we all become stingy and calculating when our wealth
        grows and we start taking money seriously.

        This quote from Nassim Taleb's <em>The Black Swan</em> caught me off
        guard upon first reading and has lingered me with me since. The story
        itself is hardly memorable, something I'd expect to find in the memoirs
        of any self-absorbed Wall Street type. What really got me was the last
        line: that there is some unflattering and unintuitive stopping point for
        our generosity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading this book at age twenty-five or so, when money started to become
        easy, this was an uncomfortable pill to swallow. After a lifetime of
        parsimony, which my close friends would be too eager to confirm, I was
        very compelled by the arguments of Effective Altruism. I had paid off my
        loans, gotten a healthy raise, and realized how little you need to live
        comfortably with no dependents. The trifle of $100, while providing
        almost no marginal utility to me, could provide a significant reduction
        in the likelihood of someone contracting malaria or prevent iodine
        deficiency in hundreds of others. Tipping taxi drivers generously became
        easy, especially since most of those tips were reimbursable.

        And then, subconsciously and slowly, it became difficult. After another
        healthy raise and promotion, I oddly found myself second guessing my
        prior commitments. The argument for generosity was just as compelling as
        before but it <em>felt</em> a lot harder to give away money. Another
        year passes and I experience a massive increase in income; enough to
        start to question the purpose of money and its role in life. While this
        is the point where most people (naively) think they would suddenly
        become generous benefactors, I find myself growing
        <em>even stingier</em>! What kind of moral deficiency was I afflicted
        with!?

        I coin this relationship the <em>Parabola of Generosity</em>. I'll save
        you the bandwidth of an image with a few words. Imagine a concave
        quadratic surface with the y-axis representing generosity and x-axis
        representing wealth. Our generosity starts off very low or negative,
        constrained by our complete lack of wealth, increases up to a point in
        as we become self-aware of our relative wealth, and then decreases
        sharply thereafter. The coefficients are dependent on the individual but
        I believe that this general shape is universal (viewed locally).

        It was around the time of finding myself past peak generosity that I
        came across this passage from Taleb. I felt seen and understood, as if
        I'd been let in on some blas&eacute; rite of passage of the wealthy.
        Unfortunately though, I did not feel vindicated; having someone else
        articulate what I was feeling did not give me the sense of righteousness
        I would have liked.

        While the Parabola provides an accurate description of experience, it
        does not make a claim about <em>why</em> an inflection point exists. I
        have yet to find a more satisfactory answer that what Taleb has
        outlined, that we start taking money seriously. Wealth goes from a
        feeling of abundance to a feeling of burden. I have a sense (maybe a
        hope) that this quadratic relationship only appears so in a local sense
        and that zooming out, the relationship becomes cubic. That we reach some
        inflection point of "fuck you" money, after which generosity begins
        increasing again. This seems to hold true for the ultra-wealthy spanning
        from the most villainized Gilded Age industrialists to Bill Gates.
        According to Wikipedia, cubic parabolas are a thing so the theory still
        stands.

        As for where I'm at now, I am glad to report that I have not stopped
        giving. Meditation and the occasional revisiting of works by Peter
        Singer and Will MacAskill help the reasoned part of my brain set up
        automated systems to bypass System 1. To someone experiencing something
        similar, I'd advise taking a step back to evaluate how your values have
        changed over time. If the change in wealth has outpaced the change in
        values, it's worth overcoming that stinginess&mdash;lest we find
        ourselves writing our own self-absorbed Wall Street type memoirs.
