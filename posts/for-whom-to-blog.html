      <p><em>tl;dr</em> definitely me, and sometimes you</p>
      <p>
        Before starting to post more, I was very cognizant about who the target
        audience of my posts was. If nobody wanted to read it then why write at
        all? And what did I have to say that was both original and additive to a
        topic? This naturally created a very high bar which resulted in many
        interesting thoughts that I dismissed entirely and a few other thoughts
        that I had thought through in many ways but felt I couldn't polish
        enough to justify a post. The result? A blog with only a single post and
        no readers.

        While discussing a slanderous
        <a
          href="https://www.robrhinehart.com/the-new-york-times/"
          target="_blank"
          >blog post</a
        >
        on the New York Times with a couple friends, I found the author's
        message to "just write" really hit home. Quality, correctness, and
        originality be damned, Rhinehart exhorts, "Write what <em>you</em> want
        to write. Write what you <em>really</em> think. The truth will come
        out." Amusingly enough my overall impression of the article was that it
        was poorly written and quite rambly, but that was the exact point!
        Despite my negative stylistic review, it had sparked a great discussion
        about the merits of mass media and journalism and left our little group
        with a great new meme about catching "octopus brain". And the beauty of
        it is that this article was written for no one but the author.

        I see my blog as some version of this. Most of what I write are personal
        meditations that I like to put into the digital aether. The advice and
        prompts are really written for different versions of me. Realizing and
        remembering that liberates me from the need for perfection or to keep an
        audience in mind.

        Hopefully these musings resonate with you in some way or another. If you
        think it sucks, that's great! Write about it and send me a link, or
        let's chat about it on our next call. If you think it's great, do the
        same. I see any additional thoughts outside of my own to be gravy on
        top. And if one of my poorly written, rambly articles sparks a
        discussion for your friend groups then consider me sincerely honored.
