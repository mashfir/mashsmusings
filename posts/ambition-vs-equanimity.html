      <p>
        With every achievement accomplished, your brain rushes with another
        high. An intense, gratifying inward cry of "I'm good enough." And
        then... it's gone. The next moment is upon you and unconsciously you
        have already scanned for the next empty box to check off. The next one
        will be the one that lasts you assure yourself, starring the empty box.
        Or the one after that &mdash; another star. You glance back at the
        tapestry of thousands of checked off boxes behind you and hesitate
        slightly. Within squinting distance you notice dozens of roughly
        pencilled stars, the handiwork of your past self.

        Years later, your brain quietly hums with contentment. You feel an itch,
        hear someone shouting something obscene, but your brain hums on. You
        have learned how to find peace by looking inward, and relishing the
        beauty of the world around you. You focus for the next twenty minutes on
        the busy soundscape and a thought drifts into your head: there was some
        greatness you had wanted wanted to achieve, perhaps now is the time. You
        are calmly confident in your ability to accomplish it. You let that
        thought sit with you for a few moments until it passes and another
        replaces it: to what end? You have found love, found peace. A warm
        summer breeze passes, and with it so do your thoughts of greatness.

        Ambition and equanimity lie in subtle yet inescapable tension. Most have
        no grip on the latter. Some try and hold onto both. None succeed. Which
        path do you choose?
