        There are a lot of ways to try to identify who your "real friends" are.
        You might think they are the people who always remember to wish you a
        happy birthday, would bail you out of jail at 2:00 am, or are the most
        fun to get drunk with. All of those criteria, and many others, have some
        merits and some flaws. However, I'd like to nominate a different
        definition. With real friends, you both have the sense that you are
        taking more from the relationship than you are getting. There exists a
        beautiful non-zero sum symmtery where each of you gain more than you put
        in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Common wisdom holds that healthy relationships are all about equality
        but is this really true? Think of relationships in which you feel
        completely equal with the other party: they may have given you something
        at some point and you returned the favor. You may have been wronged but
        some subsequent act of generosity then righted things. Everything is
        perfect... Or rather perfect<em>ly</em> fine. To me this is the
        definition of a transactional relationship and is the terminal point for
        the vast majority of relationships. There is some subconscious tally of
        where both parties stand and at the end of the day when all is
        reconciled, both parties are merely satisfied. Deeper relationships on
        the other hand always feel a little unfair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most "unfair" relationships however, don't end up lasting too long.
        Professional or personal, relationships that are too one-sided
        eventually lead to annoyance and then fizzle out unspectacularly,
        well-intentioned or not. I see it all the time: a seasoned career vet
        with heart full takes on a mentorship role, only to realize that it's
        not all that energizing to coach someone on how to get promoted every 2
        years. Even the brightest and most extroverted career superstar will
        leave every meeting feeling a little more drained, having given more
        than they received. Unfortunately, the net "taker" in the relationship
        often goes unaware, leading to some perplexing eventual heartbreak.
        While these relationships most often tend to be toxic, on rare occasions
        they evolve into what is ultimately, real friendship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Real friendship occurs when <em>both</em> parties walk away feeling like
        they got the best of it. You think about the relationship and have a
        deep sense of gratitude; after all, these are the people who have
        suffered your insufferability. Listened to your emotional outpourings,
        patted your back as you yakked out of the Uber, and inspired you when
        you felt lost. So when the time comes to lend an ear or a dollar, you
        don't even think twice. You know the scales won't balance but you're
        happy to do as much as you can in gratitude. And on the rare occasion
        where you muster up the courage to express that gratitude, you are
        slightly surprised and warmed to have that gratitude met in-kind.

        While this definition, stated eloquently by Bill Lazier and restated by
        <a

          target="_blank"
          >Jim Collins</a
        >, seems awfully selfish at first, I think it captures the true essence
        of what it <em>feels</em> like to be in a strong relationship. This
        definition extends beyond time spent together, frequency of interaction,
        or even type of relationship. And scoffs at the notion that great
        relationships are "equal" in the colloquial sense. The only tricky step
        is asking whether the other party feels the same inequality. When in
        doubt, make up your own reality where everyone loves you infinitely
        &mdash; I can't say it works forever, but I can say that it's worked for
        27 years and counting.
