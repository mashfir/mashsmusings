        Fret not my worried readers, I have not given up on #100DaysToOffload.
        After a brief few weeks of vacation, I had indeed resumed writing
        regularly, perhaps even moreso than I had before. Where are the articles
        you may ask? Are these on a separate blog or column!? No, faithful
        readers, I would never betray you like that. For the past couple weeks I
        have been writing plenty of <code>code</code>!
      </p>
      <p>
        What always strikes me is how elastic the brain can really be. Ever
        gotten back with an ex? Picked up a bike after a few years? Or even just
        started to read again? After a few uncanny minutes, your brain suddenly
        goes "brrrr" and snaps back into a rhythm. Writing for me &mdash; well,
        yeah it's the exact opposite...
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps I have not written enough in my life but after finding a good
        rhythm the elastic in my brain snaps back to not knowing how to write a
        clean sentence. And with writing arbitrary code, it's even worse. But
        fortunately, the elasticity goes both ways. After some practice problems
        and leetcode to get over the basic syntax struggles, things start to
        click again. My brain suddenly digs up that buried knowledge on
        recursion and linked lists and big O! The "brrrr" starts again.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal with writing is to change that default. Yes I'd like to get
        better, and I think I am. But what I want most is to remove that pain,
        that fear of picking a skill back up after ignoring it for a while. So
        with most of the coding out of the way, I hope to return to the
        regularly scheduled programming.

          This is part of an effort to build a habit of writing, inspired by

          on this.
