        One of the unexpectedly best lifestyle changes I've made in the last
        couple years has been to sleep better. Practically speaking, this is the
        cumulation of a few different changes: cutting out caffeine, keeping
        lights dim after dark, less drinking, etc. But none have been as
        immediately gratifying as going to bed without an alarm.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the thought of this sends a jolt of anxiety through your body, then
        you are not alone. Surely you'd miss your morning meetings, or that
        early appointment. Maybe without that palpatation-inducing alarm, you'd
        just continue in an eternal slumber. Whatever the outcome might be, it's
        certainly not going to turn out well. But as mystical as it sounds, your
        conscious fears manifest into an impressively accurate subconscious
        alarm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have you ever had that experience where there was some looming thing you
        <em>had</em> to wake up for? The kind where you set two alarms and asked
        a friend to message you just in case. For me, this was every exam or
        midterm scheduled before 11:00 am. If you're anything like me, what
        actually happens is that you find yourself suddenly wide awake
        scrambling to find your phone in a panic, certain you've doomed
        yourself&mdash;only to realize that it's 3 minutes <em>before</em> your
        alarm was set to ring. Phew.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the <var>n</var>th time of this happening, I realized that the
        precision of my internal clock was a lot higher than I was giving it
        credit for. As long as it was on my mind to wake up at a certain time
        before going to bed, I would wake up at almost exactly the right time.
        The more stressed or concerned, the earlier I'd awake. And without some
        urgent stressor and a reasonably regular bed time, I found myself waking
        up within a 15 minute window completely naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
        So why bother with no alarm if I'm waking up at the right time either
        way? It wasn't until I read <em>Why We Sleep</em> that I knew
        <em>why</em> I felt so much better from those extra few minutes. As
        we've all heard, sleep consists of many different cycles. Naturally, we
        wake at the end of a cycle when the restful benefits have been complete.
        With an alarm, we abruptly awaken mid-cycle, disrupting our rest and
        also catching us before the adenosine and cortisol mix makes us
        <em>feel</em> awake; thus the familiar desire to immediately hit snooze.
        Secondly, the alarm itself physically induces a mild shock, like a
        voluntary choice to have someone startle you awake. Over time, this more
        insidious effect results in increased risk of heart disease. Not a great
        double whammy.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any of this sounds compelling, I'd urge you to give this a shot
        whenever you don't have any early meetings. If you find yourself
        sleeping in, great! That is your body in no uncertain terms telling you
        that it needs the rest. After a few days you'll notice a very regular
        rhythm emerge and early meetings to be subconsciously handled. And more
        importantly, you'll notice just feeling refreshed first thing in the
        morning instead of a cloud of brain fog. Now don't get me wrong, this
        approach is not bulletproof: if you're crossing timezones or going to
        bed at 3:00 am, you may still need an alarm. But hopefully you come to
        think of an alarm as exactly that, an emergency tool like a smoke alarm
        or fire alarm. The ultimate sleep alarm turns out to be dynamic, silent,
        batteryless omnipresent, and made of soft tissue. You just need to let
        it run.
