        Everyone from parents to managers drills into you the importance of
        having <strong>goals</strong>. I think the first time I was taught about
        making "SMART" goals was grade 9, and it's been a mainstay ever since.
        The core message being driven home again and again was that you need
        goals to achieve anything. While I do think goals may be useful in some
        very specific short-term contexts, the supreme focus on goals does more
        harm than good.
      </p>
      <p>
        For starters, likely as a byproduct of being Specific and Measurable,
        goals tend to be extrinsic. As a result, when most people talk about
        their goals, they resemble something like, "Attain X title or $Y salary
        by age Z." And while these goals are SMART, they are certainly not
        smart. The issue is that truly meaningful goals that result in higher
        satisfaction are far fuzzier: the things we truly want such as
        fulfillment, strong relationships, and legacy do not lend themselves
        well to overspecified goals. Instead, goals bias the goalseeker towards
        checking boxes that skim the surface of success without actually diving
        into well-being.

        Instead, it is generally more helpful to have a clear sense of
        direction. By direction I mean orienting yourself towards a given value
        or lifestyle, with a much bigger focus on the "why" as opposed to the
        "what" or "how" of traditional goals. Finding direction can be difficult
        and scary, especially if you're young. But the beauty of direction is
        that it can be as vague and messy as it needs to be; regular
        <em>re</em>direction is normal and encouraged! To illustrate the
        difference, here are a few directions I've had in the past few years,
        contrasted with some similar golas I've heard:
      </p>
      <ul id="directions-goals">
        <li>
          live healthier :: go to the gym 3 days a week this year for 90 minutes
          each time
        </li>
        <li>
          get better at building things :: take course A and B in the next 6
          weeks and publish project C
        </li>
        <li>read more :: read two books a month for the next 6 months</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each of my directions are absolutely horrendous by measure of any
        goal-setting framework but their simplicity and breadth are what I find
        most powerful. By having a broad direction or theme always present in
        your mind, you can make many smaller decisions to orient towards that
        instead of tying success or failure to something arbitrarily specific.
        Taking the first example on living healthier, the broad theme led to a
        whole host of lifestyle changes encompassing sleep, caffeine, drinking,
        <em>and</em> exercise. Focus on the big picture and keep the true
        objective constantly in mind, and you'll find yourself steering your
        decisions to align in the direction you want to go.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only once you have a sense of direction, should you even start to think
        about having <em>some</em> goals. Try to keep these goals as short-lived
        as possible to avoid the risk of value drift. The longer-term the goal,
        the easier it is to find yourself committed deeply to something while
        not remembering why it was important in the first place. I see this
        manifest itself in situations with friends grinding for a couple more
        years to complete their CPA despite learning that they never want to do
        accounting. Or burning the midnight oil trying to get the promotion or
        salary increase in a role you hate. While this dogmatic focus on
        achieving our past goals feels good upon accomplishment, it pulls our
        energies away from focusing on moving in the direction we would like to
        go <em>today</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spend some time figuring out a general direction, don't overthink it to
        start. The key is to keep this direction in mind frequently. It should
        be easy to challenge, easier to revise, and probably impossible to
        complete. Make room for small cumulative, permanent changes instead of
        overindexing on time-bound commitments. Goals are overrated.
