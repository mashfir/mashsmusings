        In late January, I found myself unable to sleep. I felt anxious; a
        little scared even. But most of all... I felt excited. What would
        another day bring to the epic saga of r/wallstreetbets vs "Wall Street"?
        Would GME continue its meteoric rise to $1000? Would paper hands prevail
        and bring everything tumbling down? When would Elon or Ryan Cohen
        weigh-in on whether the squeeze was squoze? It was impossible to say and
        yet the possibilities continued to spiral through my mind. Every guy
        even remotely aware of what was going on quietly had the same thought
        pass through his mind: what it would be like if I became an overnight
        millionaire?
      </p>
      <p>
        How much skin did I have in this game you might ask? How deep was I in
        $GME such that I was losing sleep over a meme?
      </p>
      <p><em>Absolutely nothing.</em> Zip. Nada.</p>
      <p>
        And yet, this David vs Goliath narrative was powerful enough to draw me
        in. The mass media headlines and <em>8 million</em> member growth of
        r/wallstreetbets in February told me that I was not alone. While this
        type of story goes by many names, the prevailing word at the time of
        writing is populism. And though the "p" word has ugly connotations these
        days and associations with far-right extremist groups, the reality is
        that we all find ourselves caught up in the struggles of the everyman in
        some way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most worrying part for me was how emotionally invested I found
        myself <em>despite</em> my complete lack of skin in the game. What does
        that say about my susceptibility to other populist movements? Did I
        really care about Robinhood investors triumphing over Wall Street or was
        I just caught up in the excitement of watching conflict unfold and
        fortunes shift?
      </p>
      <p>
        Eric Hoffer in <em>The True Believer</em> calls out that mass movements
        are much less about the cause itself and much more about how the
        narrative unfolds and the personality traits of would-be movers. This
        theory goes against our sense of being highly conscientious moral agents
        but fits the evidence of getting caught up in GME or
        <a href="/posts/sports-are-dumb.html" target="_blank"
          >identification with sports teams</a
        >. Following the theory leads to the unsavory conclusion that there's
        not a whole lot separating Redditors trying to cancel Vlad from
        Robinhood and SJWs trying to cancel J. K. Rowling. Or, put more
        extremely, not a lot separating violent rioters in Portland from
        insurrectionists in the Capitol Building.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite Hoffer's book being published in 1951 when the consequences of
        nationalism, fascism, and communism all loomed large, the social
        psychology outlined is just as relevant 70 years later. The rise of
        populism is real and not going anywhere. And though hindsight makes it
        easy to classify which movements were right, it is not so easy to
        predict whether we will be the righteous.
      </p>
      <p>
        My suggestions on how to tackle this? Short-term: cut out news and
        social media. The sensationalism and outrage is powerfully designed to
        draw us into the movement of the day. Long-term: be explicit about your
        values, write them down and revisit them every year. Having a strong
        sense of values means that any new thing that wants to capture us must
        first pass through the gauntlet of values.
