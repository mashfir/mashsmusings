        In a couple of recent discussions with friends around books to read and
        suggestions, I drew some ire around my stance on recommendations and
        book clubs&mdash;I am not open to contemporary or topical books. This
        draws criticism without fail and yet my conviction on this has only
        strengthened.

        One compelling argument is summarized well in a Farnam Street

        If we&#39;re reading what everyone else is reading it&#39;s harder to
        think differently about problems, decisions, or life.

        There is definitely an element of truth to this but, as my friend
        pointed out, the Murakami quote around the other boys being crap is
        elitist at best. While this vague call to a sense of independence is
        appealing, there is a much better reason to focus on classics.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Adler points out in <em>How to Read a Book</em>, the reason to read
        classics is not to feel &quot;cultured&quot;&mdash;it's to understand
        the rich literary tradition behind everything we know. One cannot really
        understand the significance of <em>Reading Lolita in Tehran</em> without
        first reading <em>Lolita</em>. Or truly walk with Dante through Hell
        without knowing of Virgil. And this lack of understanding is often much
        worse in nonfiction. People nowadays praise Piketty's
        <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> with no knowledge of Marx's
        <em>Capital</em>, which Piketty is transparently trying to build upon.
        And of the few socialists who have actually read Marx, almost none have
        read Adam Smith, whose theories Marx was rebutting. To read only
        contemporary books is to spend your life skating on the tips of
        icebergs, blind to the centuries of thought that have led us to where we
        are today.

        Accepting this truth is one thing, but acting on it is another. This
        path can seem extremely daunting; once you start looking for predecessor
        after predecessor, you realize it's turtles all the way down. And that
        realization can be demotivating enough to justify abandoning the pursuit
        altogether. Fortunately, there are

        out there that help stop the infinite regress. While it would take many
        lifetimes to traverse the entire iceberg of human knowledge, you'll be
        surprised to see how far along you'll get simply by reading
        <em>The Odyssey</em> or <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em>.

        So dear reader, try taking that first step. Once you cross the chasm
        from Heather's Picks to Homer's Picks, you'll never look back.
