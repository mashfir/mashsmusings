      <h4>Published Apr. 18, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        I recently finished reading
        <em>"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman"</em> and found his life to be
        often profound, sometimes cringe, and consistently wonderful. Here is my
        ranking of some of his advice.
      </p>
      <h2>Words to live by</h2>
      <p>
        Above all else, always focus on <em>true</em> understanding. The kind
        which you get from experiencing, teaching others, and extrapolating
        beyond the homework. This idea was best summed up by an analogy in which
        he blasts the Brazilian physics program for its emphasis on volume and
        rote. Unfortunately, the style of education on blast has become the
        norm.
      </p>
      <blockquote id="greek-scholar">
        <p>
          Then I gave the analogy of a Greek scholar who loves the Greek
          language, who knows that in his own country there aren't many children
          studying Greek. But he comes to another country, where he is delighted
          to find everybody studying Greek&mdash;even the smaller kids in
          elementary schools. He goes to the examination of a student who is
          coming to get his degree in Greek, and asks him, &quot;What were
          Socrates' ideas on the relationship between Truth and
          Beauty?&quot;&mdash;and the student can't answer. Then he asks the
          student, &quot;What did Socrates say to Plato in the Third
          Symposium?&quot; the student lights up and goes,
          &quot;<em>Brrrrrrrrr-up</em>&quot;&mdash;he tells you everything, word
          for word, that Socrates said, in beautiful Greek.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what Socrates was talking about in the Third Symposium was the
          relationship between Truth and Beauty!
        </p>
        <p>
          What this Greek scholar discovers is, the students in another country
          learn Greek by first learning to pronounce the letters, then the
          words, and then sentences and paragraphs. They can recite, word for
          word, what Socrates said, without eralizing that those Greek words
          actually
          <em>mean</em> something. To the student they are all artificial
          sounds. Nobody has ever translated them into words the student can
          understand.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Try and understand the phenomena itself instead of just the word.</p>
      <blockquote id="just-a-word">
        <p>
          The answer was, for the wind-up toy, &quot;Energy makes it go.&quot;
          And for the boy on the bicycle, &quot;Energy makes it go.&quot; For
          everything, &quot;<em>Energy</em> makes it go.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that doesn't <em>mean</em> anything... The child doesn't learn
          anything; it's just a <em>word</em>!
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Make sure you have a real example to test your understanding.</p>
      <blockquote id="physical-example">
        He thinks I'm following the steps mathematically, but that's not what
        I'm doing. I have the specific, physical example of what he's trying to
        analyze, and I know from instinct and experience the properties of the
        thing.
      </blockquote>
      <p>It is foolish to seek the wisdom of the crowd.</p>
      <blockquote id="emperor-of-china">
        This question of trying to figure out whether a book is good or bad by
        looking at it carefully or by taking the reports of a lot of people who
        looked at it carelessly is like this famous old problem: Nobody was
        permitted to see the Emperor of China, and the question was, What is the
        length of the Emperor of China's nose? To find out, you go all over the
        country asking people what they think the length of the Emperor of
        China's nose is, and you
        <em>average</em> it. And that would be very "accurate" because you
        averaged so many people. But it's no way to find anything out; when you
        have a very wide range of pople who contribute without looking carefully
        at it, you don't improve your knowledge of the situation by averaging.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Reflect on the value of what it is you're achieving. It's easy to get
        caught up in the joy of achievement.
      </p>
      <blockquote id="bob-wilson">
        <p>
          After the [atomic bomb test] went off, there was tremendous excitement
          at Los Alamos. Everybody had parties, we all ran around. I sat on the
          end of a jeep and beat drums and so on. But one man, I remember, Bob
          Wilson, was just sitting there moping.
        </p>
        <p>I said, &quot;What are you moping about?&quot;</p>
        <p>He said, &quot;It's a terrible thing that we made.&quot;</p>
        <p>I said, &quot;But you started it. You got us into it.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          You see, what happened to me&mdash;what happened to the rest of
          us&mdash;is we <em>started</em> for a good reason, then you're working
          very hard to accomplish something and it's a pleasure, it's
          excitement. And you stop thinking, you know; you just <em>stop</em>.
          Bob Wilson was the only one who was still thinking about it, in that
          moment.

          "I've very often made mistakes in physics by thinking the theory isn't

          easier to just plain

          On grading elementary school textbooks: "The definitions weren't

          were faking it. They were teaching something they didn't understand,
