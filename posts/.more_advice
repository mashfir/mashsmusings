<h3>Teach as often as possible. An audience of one is plenty.</h3>
<h3>Network like a fangirl/fanboy. The goal is to learn their life story, not to get answers to yours.</h3>
<h3>Find people you look up to in at least one way. Mentors don't need to be better than you in every way. Mentors don't need to be forever.</h3>
<h3>Have a sense of direction, not goals. Goals are extremely overrated.</h3>

I often want to tell people not to have goals, even though this is wildly unpopular and perhaps not even right for most people. When people tell me their goals, they are almost always extrinsic and take the shape of "attain X title or salary of $Y by age Z". To me this seems entirely wrongheaded and counterproductive.
