        Networking is either extremely underrated or overrated, depending on
        who's asking. For a business school grad, I would say that networking is
        overrated. Networking can help with the discovery phase of finding a new
        role and can compensate for some lack of experience or skills but is not
        a silver bullet. For anyone else, networking is extremely underrated.

        As a first generation immigrant, I was taught that hard work and hard
        skills were the only keys to success. Put your head down, do good work,
        and you will be rewarded. Networking carried with it the stigma of being
        a used car salesman, hawking yourself to whoever will listen. As I have
        learned repeatedly through experience, this mentality sets up for some
        major disappointments career-wise. Practically speaking, breaking into
        new roles or top companies can be nigh hopeless without referrals. And
        on a more personal level, you have little sense of what a particular
        role <em>actually</em> entails until you chat with someone doing the
        thing.

        The biggest mistake I see is viewing networking as transactional. The
        number of LinkedIn requests I get that are either "Hi, can I have a
        referral?" or one step away from that is a testament to this fact. This
        is the professional version of opening a dating app chat with "Wanna
        fuck?" Call me a boomer but I find this pretty unappealing. The trick is
        to network well before you are actively job hunting; incorporate
        networking into the career soul-searching phase and things will seem a
        lot less intimidating. Reaching out to a stranger on LinkedIn to ask
        their thoughts on the future of tech, for example, is going to be a lot
        less intimidating than asking them work to get you a job. Most humans
        like to talk and discuss things they are interested in.

        Your goal in networking is to try and get a sense of the other person's
        life story. The best outcome will be to have made a new friend and the
        median outcome should be to get a new perspective on how to get to a
        specific career point. Imagine the attitude and questions you would have
        if you were to sit down with a career or intellectual hero of yours. Put
        yourself into that same mindset when chatting with someone new and
        you'll be pleasantly surprised at how genuinely interested you are.
        Leave some room in the conversation to share what bigger question you
        are trying to answer and where you are at but remember that this is not
        the main goal.
      </p>

        If the other person sees a match with what you've shared and what is
        available at their company, <em>let them offer up a referral</em>. Like
        dating, this will not always work out and that's fine, again remember
        that job hunting is at some level a numbers game. Feel free to ask if
        there are other people in the company that might be open to chatting
        whose journey might align more closely with yours. Chaining connections
        like this can be intimidating but teaches you to get over the nerves of
        reaching out to strangers. Seek additional perspectives and insight, and
        let referrals come through as a side effect. View networking as
        transactional and you'll find your social credit card getting declined
        more often than not.
