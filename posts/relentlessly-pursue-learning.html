        <em>Relentlessly pursue learning. What you learn is less important.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If I could only give one piece of career advice, this is it. Since
        graduation, this constant (if inconsistent) desire to continue to learn
        is what I'd say has distinguished me from my peers. The only reason this
        is not number one is because you already know you should be doing this.
        So instead I will try and motivate the <em>why</em> as opposed to
        explain the <em>how</em>, for the latter I highly recommend Barbara
        Oakley's
        <a

          target="_blank"
          >course</a
        >. The big secret that no one believes is that by focusing on learning,
        you incidentally end up achieving the more traditional goals you may be
        occupied with. <strong>This does not go both ways!</strong> Media
        conditions us to believe that if you are driven by wealth and prestige,
        you will self-improve your way there. But consistently the wealthiest
        people I have met, especially when controlling for background and age,
        are all intensely motivated by their own curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
        By focusing solely on learning, you free yourself up from the political
        games and posturing. The vast majority of people I've worked with are
        <em>far</em> harder workers than me both in hours and energy. I can't
        count the number of times I have stayed in the office a couple hours
        extra to do some coursework and still left before my team, working to
        complete some soon-to-be-forgotten slides. These are the same people who
        inevitably find they lack the energy or time to pursue learning,
        ironically opting to focus on "career". If this is you, make a hard
        stop. Grinding at work to earn the next promotion will always make sense
        in the short-term but squash your motivation for long-term development,
        and nobody will stop you from making that trade-off. Put in the
        additional hours for work insofar as it overlaps with learning something
        interesting, optimize for the short-term when it synergizes with the
        long-term.
      </p>
      <p>
        In math terms, learning is highly non-linear and thus
        <em>really</em> difficult to keep motivated in a regular way. If you've
        ever been toiling on a problem for hours only to have the solution seem
        glaringly obvious the next moment, you've experienced this nonlinearity.
        Hustling at work, on the other hand, tends to feel much more linear:
        grind a little bit more, get a little more work done. Our brains get
        linearity, our brains like it. You could nonlinearly struggle your way
        to an elegant solution to what you're working on but that could take
        days or weeks, and you could just brute force it in a few hours instead.
        Do you optimize for the short-term or the long-term? Zooming out, this
        nonlinear learning function turns out to be exponential, and if you zoom
        out far enough, an exponential will eventually outpace any linear
        function.
      </p>
      <p>
        What you are learning is less important than learning something of
        interest to you. People often feel guilty or stressed about not
        committing to learning what they "should" be learning but this is really
        just a more subtle extrinsic motivator. It surprises some people to
        learn that I read fiction and yet I probably read more novels than
        everything else combined. When I talk about pursuing learning, I mean
        simply mean actively pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. The
        beautiful thing about knowledge is how it builds on itself even across
        domains, a fact which is doubly true if you focus on first principles
        and intuition. Don't get so caught up in trying to learn the right
        things, just apply whatever it is you're learning as broadly as
        possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is okay to not always have the energy to learn (I certainly don't)
        and at times there will be more important things to worry about. But if
        you find yourself lost about what you want to learn or worse, have no
        desire to learn, take a step back and start small. Try looking up the
        recipe for that new dish you've been meaning to cook; try skimming the
        introduction to that book you've been meaning to read. Or, my favorite,
        ask a friend who loves explaining things about something they learned
        recently and drill them with questions. Try to find that spark of
        curiosity. If you've read this far then the kindling is already there.
