        With the Canadian federal elections coming up, I found myself having to
        change my generally apolitical posture to fill the role of engaged
        citizen. As someone with no particular fondness for any one political
        party, this usually involves going through some of the platforms and
        reflecting on my current values. After some high-level research, I will
        usually check out something like
        <a href="https://votecompass.cbc.ca" target="_blank">Vote Compass</a> to
        assist in the final decision making. Having done this bare minimum of
        work, I go back to political hibernation until the next election,
        satisfied that I have done my part in the democratic process. Asking
        others about their decision process usually returns one of two answers:
        vote for the same party as always, or choose the prime ministerial
        candidate they like the most. While I've snubbed my nose at both of
        these approaches, I have gained some appreciation for the latter.

        I've held the view that voting for your favorite politician, as so many
        do, to be a wrongheaded cop out. When thinking of the complexities that
        go behind running an effective government&mdash;economic policy, foreign
        affairs, and now even pandemic response&mdash;it seems crazy to think
        that one's competencies in all these disciplines is in any way
        correlated with one's ability to win a popularity contest. Focusing
        solely on the politician leads to cults of personality and adopting the
        views of the leaders instead of adopting leaders whose views align with
        yours. However, I realized it is not so simple and is perhaps the high
        price to pay for convenience.

        To really vote based on platform means educating yourself about a wide
        variety of issues and carefully comparing which party's values align
        most closely with yours. This requires some baseline level of knowledge
        on any topic researched, an understanding of the players involved in
        those decisions, and a picture of which policies <em>could</em> be the
        most effective at some point in the future. Assuming you have the
        prerequisite level of multidisciplinary education, this is no easy task.
        On the conservative end, this would require dozens of hours of reading
        to get anything close to a holistic view. A noble goal for sure, and the
        hallmark of a truly engaged citizen but certainly not realistic or even
        possible for everyone voting for an election. Going through Vote Compass
        this year I realized I had no clue what the Canadian government was
        doing in terms of policing or Indigenous reconciliation which makes it
        hard to have an opinion on whether they ought to do more or less; and I
        would bet the majority of citizens have similar knowledge gaps (although
        this rarely prevents strong opinions). Enter: voting for the politician.

        Imagine having a close friend who had purportedly had done his homework.
        You've heard his takes and trust that he is sincere in his views. Having
        heard this friend speak many times, you are confident that you two are
        <em>mostly</em> aligned on values, at least moreso than anyone else
        you've speak on politics. Would it not be reasonable in this case to
        proxy your vote through your friend? On some level, I think this is how
        99% of us actually operate when it comes to forming opinions on
        anything. We hear something that resonates with us from a high integrity
        individual, probe a bit into the rationale, and then accept or reject
        the argument presented. Representational democracy is really just an
        extension of the same idea. Replace your friend with your local MP and
        you have the current system in place today.

        Voting for the politician is a vote of trust more than it is a vote on
        policy. It is a vote that the politician's values are aligned with yours
        and that you trust their ability to execute on them. Not to say that
        they know everything or will always make the best choice, but rather
        that they'll act in accordance to the values they have stated.
      </p>

        I think as I grow older and perhaps a little more jaded when it comes to
        politics, I can see the justification for voting for the politican. The
        noble idea that every citizen becomes a bastion of his own individual
        political worldview seems naive. I think where I've landed personally is
        somewhere in between the two approaches. Do the homework to get a broad
        sense of platforms; this serves to make your values at least somewhat
        explicit. Find the party that most closely aligns with your values and
        run a quick trustworthiness check: does the federal candidate seem
        trustworthy to you? Does the candidate in your local riding seem
        trustworthy to you? This probably requires some digging. If not, then
        repeat this exercise with the next party in power. If you get to the
        bottom of the list and you still find no good candidates, perhaps it's
        time to start your own party. The only question is: do you trust
        yourself?
