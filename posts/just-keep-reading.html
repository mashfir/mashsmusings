        I, like most people my age, used to <em>love</em> reading as a kid. Like
        seriously love it. To the point where my mom would have to come take
        away my flashlight after a new <em>Artemis Fowl</em> or
        <em>Harry Potter</em> book came out so I wouldn't stay up all night
        reading. And yet, as I grew up and video games got fancier, broadband
        internet entered our home, and the nightmarish social pressures of
        puberty became a thing, I forgot about reading. It wasn't a strong
        conviction or anything, it just simply faded away. Reading became an
        activity for school, not for fun. And then at some point reading became
        a virtue, a painful rite of passage to show how smart you were.

      <p>
        As a result, it took me a full decade to start reading again. And many
        months after that before I started reading for fun. Ten years of
        learnings gone, emotions not experienced, perspectives unchallenged. It
        was a quote from Naval Ravikant that made me realize what I got wrong 10
        years ago.

      <blockquote cite="https://nav.al/love-read">
        Everybody I know who reads a lot loves to read, and they love to read
        because they read books that they loved. Itâ€™s a little bit of a
        catch-22, but you basically want to start off just reading wherever you
        are and then keep building up from there until reading becomes a habit.
        And then eventually, you will just get bored of the simple stuff.

        There were plenty of books that I loved to read but at some point that
        seemed like the wrong thing to do. Reading for fun was no longer cool
        and then over time, it became a big thing. A reminder to drop the
        pretense and just pick up a book, any book, when I'm restless or on
        vacation would have been great. Keep the habit, embrace the guilty
        reads! Just keep reading. Doesn't matter what, doesn't matter when,
        doesn't matter for how long. Just keep reading.
