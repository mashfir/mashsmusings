          Finding her mother's silver tin of gifts received from her late father
          and carefully touching each memento.
        </li>
        <li>Coming second in the school-wide egg and spoon race.</li>
        <li>
          Singing in a two-minute spot on the only broadcast channel in the
          country.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finishing graduate school in spite of all the protests that she ought
          to focus on getting married.
        </li>
        <li>Taking home her newborn son after a protracted hospitalization.</li>
        <li>
          Crawling around the apartment playing with her kids to turn "run from
          the cockroaches" into a fun game.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leaving her son looking back wistfully for his first day of school.
          And sitting outside the school for hours afterwards just in case
          something went wrong.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reading her daughter's first Father's Day card, remembering the brown
          paper craft tie glued on and the misspelt message of "I lov mi dad!"
        </li>
        <li>
          Spending hours beside her dying mother getting recipes written nowhere
          and passed to no others.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preparing new dishes for her adult children, grateful to COVID for
          providing a rare opportunity to be under the same roof.
        </li>
      </ul>

        These are my mother's most valued collection of treasures. A collection
        of simple memories punctuating the circle of life of a bygone era, of a
        full human life.
      </p>
      <p>
        This inheritance, this remembrance, I realized today that these same
        memories will one day be my most valued collection of treasures.
