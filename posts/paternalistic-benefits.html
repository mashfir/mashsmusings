        Some things in life are so commonplace and mundane that we never stop to
        question them. Only when you see things done another, perhaps
        contradictory, way you're left wondering why you never questioned it in
        the first place. Like the first time learning that some countries drive
        on the opposite side of the road. Or when you met someone certain they
        don't want children. I recently had this existential crisis with
        workplace benefits.

        In Apr. 2021, the cofounders of Basecamp faced intense backlash for

        changes that included a ban on societal and political discussions on
        company account. While this is worth opining on (see thoughts
        <a href="/posts/office-sans-politics.html" target="_blank">here</a>), it
        was the overshadowed second change that really caught me off guard.

        <strong>2. No more paternalistic benefits.</strong> For years we've
        offered a fitness benefit, a wellness allowance, a farmer's market
        share, and continuing education allowances. They felt good at the time,
        but we've had a change of heart. It's none of our business what you do
        outside of work, and it's not Basecamp's place to encourage certain
        behaviors &mdash; regardless of good intention. By providing funds for
        certain things, we're getting too deep into nudging people's personal,
        individual choices.

        This concept of providing taxable non-cash benefits has been around for
        a while but the psychology of it was formalized by Richard Thaler and
        Cass Sunstein, and published in their book <em>Nudge</em>. Along with
        the rationale was coined the term "libertarian paternalism", a term
        meant to evoke images of a loving father raising a free-thinking child
        under his wise and knowing tutelage. But stated directly, the philosophy
        dictates that institutions should exert their will through subtle
        psychologial manipulation, while still leaving us free to overcome them.
        This to me is the Nobel Prize-winning version of the
        passive-aggressiveness. Your libertarian paternalistic roommates aren't
        <em>forcing</em> you to do the dishes but they might stop mentioning
        which one of them did the dishes last week if you do.

        Universally, these paternalistic workplace benefits are
        well-intentioned. Stripe initially had an unlimited vacation policy but,
        like other employers, found that employees were still getting burnt out
        and not taking enough vacation. The solution? Re-implement accruals and
        caps. This was clearly a thought-out move to benefit employees, by using
        loss aversion to overpower cultural and self-imposed stigmas around
        taking "too much" vacation. And recently, this was ramped up through
        additional days that had to be used within the next 3 or 6 months or
        lost forever. These nudges, the employer equivalent of "Limited time
        only!" sales tactics, are based on the assumption that employers know
        what's better for us than we do. The focus could have been to send
        communications to reduce stigma and empower employees, with management
        leading by example. But instead, employers choose the lazier nudging
        approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        The unsettling aspect is that, while well-intentioned, benefits are used
        in ways that are the least likely to be questioned as opposed to what is
        truly best for us. The biggest example is the frequent availability of
        alcohol as a benefit. If employers really wanted the healthiest outcome
        for employees, they could simply state that the company would only be
        expensing non-alcoholic drinks. Or better yet, prevent sending messages
        for non-mission critical employees between 10:00 pm &ndash; 6:00 am to
        encourage sleeping well. While objectively healthier, nudges like these
        would be far too overt to be palatable by employees. The watchful
        paternalistic hand must avoid raising suspicion.

        Weirdly though, even hyper-analytical people seem to enjoy these
        paternalistic benefits instead of demanding that they be paid out. I
        think this highlights the depth of our mental accounting bias, the
        tendency for us to not view money as fungible. We view a $1000 education
        benefit as a huge improvement over a $0 education benefit but a view a
        $1000 raise as insultingly low on a $100k salary. This presents
        employers an arbitrage opportunity: boosting employee satisfaction by
        reapportioning compensation to smaller benefits instead of increasing
        total compensation. But aside from situations with bulk purchasing
        benefits such as health insurance, I'd always rather have the cash to
        make my own choices. Benefits are not some free lunch but rather chunks
        of your compensation that have been locked up to be released with good
        behavior. The paternal hand will only give us our allowance if we spend
        it "the right way".

        This whole system leads to some weird conclusions: Does your employer
        offer a stop-smoking benefit? Smoking employees get paid more. How about
        a gym benefit? Fitter employees get paid more. Retirement account
        matching? Scrupulous employees get paid more. Compensation starts
        getting linked to completely extrinsic behaviors but the ubiquity and
        positive framing of these benefits lead us to never give pause. As Gerd
        Gigerenzer calls out in his paper
        <em>The Bias Bias in Behavioral Economics</em>, a focus on maximizing
        autonomy and education are the long-term solutions to better outcomes.
        If we are able to learn from their mistakes and decide what is best for
        ourselves, then why do we let our employer guide our lifestyle outside
        of work? Next time your employer starts listing off their benefits, ask
        whether you can take them in cash. After all, who knows what's best for
        you?
