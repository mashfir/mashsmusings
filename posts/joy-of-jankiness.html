      <p>
        As my blog posts continue, I realize that having every single post in
        its entirety on on page will not scale. It's difficult to read through
        earlier posts, there are no previous or next links. There are no tags to
        organize for the different topics. Fixing any of these problems poses a
        non-trivial challenge considering my static site generator is composed
        of a single bash script. And yet, in spite of (or perhaps because of)
        that jankiness, I love my site.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is something special about simplicity and understanding. While I
        could have easily solved all those problems with a WordPress site, I
        would have lost all the pain and struggle that came with figuring out
        how to add a simple link to my nav bar. I would have lost the joy that
        comes with cooking your own meal, building your own computer, or even
        changing your own oil. It doesn't matter how simple or mundane the task
        is, it matters that you are closer to mastery in some small domain. With
        every big push in tech to outsource everything, from couriers to deliver
        food to personal assistants to answer emails, we get further from this
        general mastery. Further from the master-of-all-trades Renaissance man
        of old that we idealize.
      </p>
      <p>
        Refuse the conveniences, take a peek under the hood, and focus on the
        <em>bare minimum</em> that you care about, and tackle it from first
        principles. This is how to find flow, this is how to gain mastery.
      </p>

        As things scale, I'm sure I'll learn why using two text files for a
        database is not a good idea. Or why hardcoding html snippets in a bash
        file is bad practice. I look forward to it. But until then, please enjoy
        my janky site in all its leanness and "charm" in the same way you'd
        enjoy a friend's first attempt at cooking for you in college. Every
        great chef starts somewhere.
