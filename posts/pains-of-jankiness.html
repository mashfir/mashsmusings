        How easy it is to forget the pains that come along with trying to DIY
        everything.

        Just when I thought I'd started to wrap my head around some of the finer
        points of configuring Vim just the way I like it, I was hit with a
        painful roadblock. While trying to write a Python script, I noticed that
        despite the syntax highlighting working as expected, nothing I do could
        get the indentation right. Unfortunately indentation is far from
        superficial in Python meaning I would have to install some new plugin to
        autoformat things and fix whatever was broken &mdash; not exactly how I
        wanted to spend my Sunday.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flash forward two hours later and it turns out all of this fuss was due
        to a buggy <code>if</code> statement in my .vimrc, bleh. Did I learn
        some new things? Yes, I suppose I now have a better appreciation for how
        Vim handles filetypes and indentation. But the real lesson here was one
        high school teachers tried to hammer home a long time ago, don't copy
        random (.vimrc) files from the interwebs without knowing what they're
        doing. A reminder for future me that it's better to focus on
        understanding the basics instead of FOMOing about the fancy stuff.
