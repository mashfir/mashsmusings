      <p>
        I wrote recently about the path of learning SQL and I wanted to take a
        little excursion into what step 6 can look like. In that recent post, I
        provided examples of when one can use window functions. We generally
        want to compare things between days or some other aggregated measure.
        Unfortunately, as anyone working with data knows, the source data is
        often at a transactional level with many many records per day. This
        problem is easily handled by CTEs: first we aggregate our records by day
        as a CTE and then we apply the window functions to the aggregated CTE.
        But, did you know that this can (in most SQL engines) be elegantly and
        concisely written <em>without</em> the use of a CTE? Let's take a look
        at an example.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's say that we have a table of temperature recordings and we want to
        compare the change in daily highs. We have a table
        <code>temps</code> that records the <code>time</code> and
        <code>temp</code> at given reading. And because we are sane and
        sensible, we record our temperature in Celsius.
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>time</th>
            <th>temp</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>2021-07-01 12:14:42</td>
            <td>20.0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2021-07-01 17:01:14</td>
            <td>25.0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2021-07-02 06:08:22</td>
            <td>18.0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2021-07-02 20:00:11</td>
            <td>23.0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2021-07-03 04:39:21</td>
            <td>14.0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2021-07-03 11:30:00</td>
            <td>21.0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2021-07-03 22:09:43</td>
            <td>18.0</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        The first step would involve figuring out the max temperatures for each
        day.
      </p>
      <code>
        <pre>
SELECT date_trunc('day', time) AS day, max(temp) AS max_temp
FROM temps
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
</pre
        >
      </code>
      <p>Which gets us:</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>day</th>
            <th>max_temp</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>2021-07-01</td>
            <td>25.0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2021-07-02</td>
            <td>23.0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2021-07-03</td>
            <td>21.0</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        Now with a little window function wizardry, we can compute our
        day-over-day change.
      </p>
      <code>
        <pre>
WITH daily AS (
  SELECT date_trunc('day', time) AS day, max(temp) AS max_temp
  FROM temps
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 1
)
SELECT *,
       lag(max_temp) OVER(ORDER BY day) AS yesterday_max,
       max_temp - lag(max_temp) OVER(ORDER BY day) AS dod_change
FROM daily
</pre
        >
      </code>
      <p>Which gets us:</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>day</th>
            <th>max_temp</th>
            <th>yesterday_max</th>
            <th>dod_change</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>2021-07-01</td>
            <td>25.0</td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2021-07-02</td>
            <td>23.0</td>
            <td>25.0</td>
            <td>-2.0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2021-07-03</td>
            <td>21.0</td>
            <td>23.0</td>
            <td>-2.0</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        All is well and we have what we need. But we can do better than that!
      </p>
      <code>
        <pre>
SELECT date_trunc('day', time) AS day,
       max(temp) AS max_temp,
       lag(max(temp)) OVER(ORDER BY date_trunc('day', time)) AS yesterday_max,
       max(temp) - lag(max(temp)) OVER(ORDER BY date_trunc('day', time)) AS dod_change
FROM temps
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
</pre
        >
      </code>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>day</th>
            <th>max_temp</th>
            <th>yesterday_max</th>
            <th>dod_change</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>2021-07-01</td>
            <td>25.0</td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2021-07-02</td>
            <td>23.0</td>
            <td>25.0</td>
            <td>-2.0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2021-07-03</td>
            <td>21.0</td>
            <td>23.0</td>
            <td>-2.0</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

        Slick! If you look carefully, all we really did was sub in
        <code>max(temp)</code> and <code>date_trunc('day', time)</code> into our
        window function where we previously had used the aliased fields
        <code>max_temp</code> and <code>day</code> respectively. This nesting
        can look quite confusing at first, especially if you start doing things
        like <code>sum(count(*)) OVER()</code> to get the total count of records
        by day but I think it is wonderfully clear when you understand what's
        happening.
      </p>

        Like all things, practice makes perfect. Don't expect to get this right
        the first time. But next time you see this pattern of aggregation then
        window function, stretch yourself and see if you can do it in one shot.
        Who knows who you can become with all the extra time saved from writing
        those 5 extra lines of code!?
