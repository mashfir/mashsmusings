      <p>
        The rigidity of SQL is both a blessing and a curse. Once you "get it",
        you really get it, there are almost no surprises. But its inflexible
        syntax and difficulty to test also means that it can take some time to
        grok and lead to lots of silent errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confusingly, SQL is not executed top to bottom, the manner in which a
        human would read it. Reasoning about and reading SQL in the actual
        execution order, as outlined below, provides much greater clarity. One
        general tip is to use CTEs (Common Table Expressions AKA
        <code>WITH</code> statements) liberally to keep things organized.
      </p>
      <h2><code>FROM</code></h2>
      <p>
        The most important part of any query and where the source of most
        mistakes. Reasoning about this involves visualizing, mentally or on
        paper, the <em>full</em> expansion of each join. Make sure you can state
        exactly what the the primary keys are on each table before joining.
        Write out some rows you expect to be dropped with inner joins, some rows
        you expect to be empty with outer joins, and some rows you expect to be
        duplicated/expanded if you're not joining two tables at the exact same
        level of aggregation. Joining at the wrong level of aggregation is
        really easy and won't return any errors, quietly returning a completely
        incorrect number.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of this step you should have a sense of some giant megatable
        you're creating and be satisfied with what each row in the megatable
        represents. This is likely different than what your left-most table
        started with. Most of the columns in your megatable will never be used
        and the columns you joined on will likely be duplicated&mdash;this is
        okay.
      </p>
      <h2><code>WHERE</code></h2>
      <p>
        Once you have your megatable, decide which rows you don't need. This
        part is relatively well understood. The most common mistake seen stems
        from trying to filter on fields in joined tables when nothing was
        actually joined. Again, having a clear visualization of the megatable
        will help avoid this. Also be explicit about how you handle nulls: if A
        is null and B is 1, A != B may not do what you expect...
      </p>
      <h2><code>GROUP BY</code></h2>
      <p>
        You should know what level of aggregation you need for your
        output&mdash;<em>only group by those fields</em>! This is the second
        most common source of confusion. If you find yourself starting to group
        by numeric fields, stop! If you find yourself grouping by fields that
        are 1:1 or 1:many with your main field, stop! Really common mistakes
        would be grouping by city, state, and country or grouping by person_id,
        person_name, and title. In both of these situations, what you're really
        trying to do is just group by city or person_id first (within a CTE) and
        <em>then</em> join in the additional fields; the additional grouping
        fields are completely redundant! Adding all sorts of unnecessary
        groupings makes the query perform worse and adds confusion.
      </p>
      <h2><code>HAVING</code></h2>
      <p>
        Did you know that this even exists? <code>WHERE</code> but applied at
        the level of <code>GROUP BY</code>. Only want to find duplicates? Only
        care about groups above a certain threshold? This is where you encode
        it.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <code>SELECT</code>
      </h2>
      <p>
        While this seems like the meat and potatoes when first learning, this is
        really near the end of the process and should be straightforward after
        thinking through everything else. Be frugal with what fields you're
        pulling; a <code>SELECT *</code> might be quick to write but could slow
        you down 10x in run time. Window functions can get tricky and are
        outside of the scope of this post.
      </p>
      <h2><code>ORDER BY</code></h2>
      <p>
        You're almost there! Given how late this is in the execution, you can
        order by all the fancy new fields you defined in the last step (aside
        from window functions, womp womp).
      </p>
      <h2><code>LIMIT</code></h2>
      <p>
        You made it! Try to be frugal here as well since you probably just want
        to make sure things are working. Forgetting this can lead to some long
        wait times as your front-end tries to download 1 GB files when a few KB
        would have sufficed.
