      <h4>Published May. 13, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        I was recently discussing the place of politics in the workforce with a
        friend and former colleague. In explaining the importance of pushing
        anti-racism initiatives at work, he stated,
        <em
          >"If you're not a part of the solution, then you're a part of the
          problem."</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I understood the sentiment, one heard frequently in the last year. I
        empathized with why he felt banning political activism was such a
        harmful policy and we moved on. But this left me wondering... Is this
        true? Are we morally culpable for the wrongs around us? This should,
        after all, have a great impact on our behavior and self-worth.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we were to grant this as true, this would lead to some truly
        horrifying conclusions about our own lives. Around the world there are
        millions of people dying and suffering from easily preventable diseases.
        Diseases like measles which have been all but forgotten in North America
        still kill hundreds of children. How many of deaths do we personally
        take culpability for? How many of the homeless that we walk by everyday
        do we take responsibility for?
      </p>
      <p>
        The most compelling articulation for a moral imperative I've found is in
        Peter Singer's famous essay
        <a

          target="_blank"
          ><em>Famine, Affluence, and Morality</em></a
        >, reiterated in his book

      <blockquote id="drowning-child">
        On your way to work, you pass a small pond. On hot days, children
        sometimes play in the pond, which is only about knee-deep. The weather's
        cool today, though, and the hour is early, so you are surprised to see a
        child splashing about in the pond. As you get closer, you see that it is
        a very young child, just a toddler, who is flailing about, unable to
        stay upright or walk out of the pond. You look for the parents or
        babysitter, but there is no one else around. The child is unable to keep
        her head above the water for more than a few seconds at a time. If you
        don't wade in and pull her out, she seems likely to drown. Wading in is
        easy and safe, but you will ruin the new shoes you bought only a few
        days ago, and get your suit wet and muddy. By the time you hand the
        child over to someone responsible for her, and change your clothes,
        you'll be late for work. What should you do?
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Well?... The argument is powerful in the almost rhetorical question
        posed at the end. Singer states that by choosing not to donate or work
        on this problem, we are choosing to walk past the drowning child. Taking
        this line of reasong to its conclusion, every dollar spent in excess of
        a spartan life is a choice to walk past this child. Aware of this and
        true to form, Singer has pledged to donate all of his income above
        something like a $15k salary. And yet, even Singer does not assign
        culpability by omission.
      </p>
      <p>
        The guilt by omission rhetoric is wielded at the breaking of every big
        news story. By flocking around today's solution, the wielders, by their
        own accord, become a part of yesterday's problem. Singer's point is that
        we ought to make a change, <em>not</em> because we're culpable, but
        because <em>we can</em>. Instead of assigning guilt or complicity unto
        others, we should consider how effectively <em>we</em> can make a
        difference. And given our limited resources, especially our
        <a href="/parabola-of-generosity.html" target="_blank">generosity</a>,
        we should strive to make the most of them. Real change, like investing,
        requires long-term compounding. Focusing on the latest cause is as
        likely to help society as investing in the latest meme coin is likely to
        make us rich. Focus on finding what is impactful and what is effective,
        and like Singer put your money where your mouth is.
