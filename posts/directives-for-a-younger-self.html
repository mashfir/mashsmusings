        Every time I read the work of wunderkinder like Vitalik Buterin or
        Patrick Collison, I find myself awestruck by what they had accomplished
        at such a young age. During the time in which they were reading
        cryptography papers and great Western classics, I was busy organizing
        drop parties in Varrock and PQs in Kerning City. Take Patrick's
        <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/advice" target="_blank">advice</a>
        for 10-20 year olds for example. How many 10 year olds could actually
        internalize this? I'm not even sure that I was thinking on this level at
        20 and can only hope to get there at 30.
      </p>

        This stark difference has made me wonder what advice <em>would</em> have
        reached through to an obstinate arrogant younger me. While I don't think
        I could have convinced that self to read esoteric books or practice
        meditation, I do think that simple
        <a href="https://sive.rs/2do" target="_blank">directives</a> summarizing
        the lessons could have piqued some curiosity. And so, the next few posts
        will be my attempt at collecting some of these directives.
