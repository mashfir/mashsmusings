        In March 2019, I had one of the most eye-opening (pun intended)
        experiences of my life.
      </p>
      <p>"For the next three minutes, gaze into your partner's eyes."</p>
      <p>
        Partner, in this case, referred to a stranger who'd I'd spoken to for
        less than five minutes. Wasn't this supposed to be a course on
        rationality? The previous weeks covered topics such as mental models and
        Bayesian thinking so what was with this weird stuff? Mostly to avoid the
        greater embarrassment of sitting out, I played along.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first few seconds were easy, our eyes met with a mutual
        acknowledgement of the comedy of the situation. The rest of the first
        minute ended up being an unspoken game of "Who will laugh first?" The
        discomfort of just gazing directly into a stranger's eyes for some
        reason made everyone in the room want to giggle, presumably in the hope
        that laughter would dissolve the awkwardness. It did not...
      </p>
      <p>
        We get through the initial giggles and enter minute two. I stifled my
        laughter and intensified my gaze, doubling down on my resolve to make it
        through this without feeling totally emasculated. Somewhere within that
        second minute, I found myself smiling again, but this time not out of
        embarrassment. I noticed we're both smiling and that now there was a
        sense of warmth and comfort associated with it. My intensity turned to
        curiosity, "Who is this other human looking at me? How is she feeling?
        How did she come to be staring into my eyes today?" And of course, "Is
        she thinking what I'm thinking?"
      </p>
      <p>
        The final minute ended far too quickly. By that time we were pointing
        out interesting features in each other's eyes and reflecting on how
        weird it is to be afraid of this. We're in the middle of sharing our
        life stories interrupted&mdash;"Time's up."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now for the next two minutes discuss how you felt but start each
        sentence with 'When you say that, I feel...' And state an actual
        feeling: confusion, excitement, embarrassment. None of this 'I feel
        <em>like</em>...' that we usually use, instead of actually sharing how
        we feel. Share your acutal feelings. We are always mentally preparing
        what we want to say next while the other person is talking, what they
        say is usually secondary. See how that changes now."
      </p>
      <p>
        What followed was what I can only describe as a conversation with a
        friend of many years. Of the sort that you only have
        <em>after</em> you've spent hours catching up on the mundane. There was
        no shame in talking about my embarrassment or her intimidation, just
        open sharing of raw emotions. For the rest of that day, I found myself
        effortlessly engaged and attentive to whatever this stranger had to say.
        My posture had changed from its usual skepticism to an open curiosity.
        And incredibly, that instant reflex to start preparing what I wanted to
        say next had disappeared, I wanted to make sure I caught her every word
        first. In the span of five minutes, we'd accomplished what would
        normally take a couple hours of EDM music and a healthy dose of MDMA.
      </p>
      <p>
        Up to that point in my life, my approach to persuading others involved
        presenting facts, setting up logical arguments, and calling out biases
        or fallacies. This was in line with my understanding of rationality:
        whoever presented the most undeniable evidence was right. I was, of
        course, always right so cue my confusion at my general inability to
        persuade almost anyone. I would occassionally convince a close friend of
        something or another, often begrudgingly, so I chalked up the rest of my
        failed attempts to the irrationality of the other party; they just
        weren't thinking about things the right way.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what I learned that day in the rationality course was that being
        truly rational meant meeting other people where they were at. Once you
        take even a little bit of time to build empathy, making yourself
        understood becomes easy. My decision to continue my debate-style
        approach despite its horrendous success demonstrated
        <em>my</em> irrationality first and foremost. Being rational involved
        understanding others' perspectives <em>in their own words</em> before
        attempting to change them. In my childish world view, I had conflated
        correctness with rationality, and ended up often missing the mark on
        both.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that day, I immediately dove in to Marshall Rosenberg's work on
        <em>Nonviolent Communications</em>, the source of inspiration for the
        exercises. While going through the motions felt painfully awkward and
        forced, the results were truly remarkable. Without even having the
        conversations, I felt as if I understood people better, revitalizing my
        posture towards relationships I'd soured for many years. I tried eagerly
        to recommend it to anyone within earshot but pitching a YouTube

          >video</a
        >
        of an old man wearing hand puppets is admittedly not an easy sell.
        Reassuringly however, after reading
        <em>Never Split the Difference</em> and
        <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em>, I realized that all
        these books were saying the same thing, tailored to different audiences.
        A hostage negotiator, a self-help guru, and an international peacemaker
        all had the same basic truth: that people need to be understood to
        change, and the only way to get there is to listen without trying to be
        heard. Develop empathy as a rational tool. To be truly rational is to
        choose the most effective method of persuasion.
