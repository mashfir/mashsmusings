        Consumerism, conformism, and anxiety. These are three words I have tried
        hard to avoid in recent years. And yet, after watching this excellent
        video essay by J.J. McCullough on
        <a href="https://vid.puffyan.us/watch?v=OsUEbN6NZr0" target="_blank"
          ><em>What is Middle Class?</em></a
        >, I can say that these three words truly capture a lot of the culture I
        find myself steeped in, for better and worse.
      </p>
      <h2>Consumerism</h2>
      <p>
        Getting super identified over specific brands? Check. Finding pride in
        little material luxuries? Check.
      </p>
      <h2>Conformism</h2>
      <p>
        One of the things I have struggled with is the tension between wanting
        to achieve "greatness" and finding gratitude towards with the simpler
        things. The idea that this tension between achieving individuality and
        reaching common goals is a "middle class" idea is an interesting one. It
        makes me wonder what individualist goals the other middle class
        immigrant families I grew up around were trying to achieve.
      </p>
      <h2>Anxiety</h2>
      <p>
        Wow do I remember the social anxieties experienced growing up. Careful
        deliberation around which tableware to buy, especially the useless ones
        meant only for display. And the strict adherence to avoiding the slang
        that my parents would use when talking to friends and family; having
        children speak in slang is, of course, a sign of being low class.
      </p>

        I find so much of my introspection these days attempts to wholesale
        reject these characteristics that are so emblematic of the world around
        me. My real takeaway from this video is that it is possible to
        appreciate middle class culture as what it is, without adopting the
        values as my own. Perhaps one day, I will be able to let go of some of
        these values more completely. But until then... Coke over Pepsi, PS over
        Xbox, and Mac over PC any day &mdash; come at me.
