      <p>
        It wasn't until I sat down that I realized something was different, this
        was not the familiar routine of the past year. I was about to pull out
        my phone but I hesitated, getting the sense that I wasn't alone. I swear
        I could hear things: shuffling of feet, rustling of clothes, the
        faintest of exhalations perhaps. I had definitely heard the click of the
        door lock but the supreme privacy that generally comes with that was
        notably absent.
      </p>
      <p>
        I listened carefully again and this time had no doubts: I could
        definitely hear others, one, maybe two at most. There were no voices,
        these strangers were trying not to be heard but in the relative quiet, I
        could hear them nevertheless. I didn't know the others but I knew what
        they wanted, we were all here for the same reason after all. In that
        knowledge I found solace. And in that solace, I realized the intimacy of
        the moment, the spiritual and physical closeness of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did not know whether I had missed this intimacy and I fear admitting
        that even now; all I can say for certain is that this felt new again.
        Whatever I may hide about my feelings, I cannot escape the truth of the
        fraternal bond so silently formed. I wonder if this is how it's always
        been and whether this is how it will always be from here on out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever the answer, I remember that I came here with a mission, I could
        not afford to be distracted any longer; time to get back to the task at
        hand. With that resolve, I finish pooping and get back before my next
        meeting. Duty calls.
