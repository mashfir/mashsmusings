        What are the "essential" things we should learn as students? Nowadays, I
        often hear "coding is the language of the future" or "everyone should
        learn how to program" but like most maxims, this is a gross
        simplification. Yes, everyone who spends 8+ hours a day on a computer
        should learn something about how to use it more effectively, but
        everyone should not be a programmer. However, I firmly believe that
        there are a few foundational skills outside of the current curriculum
        that literally everyone should learn, especially before college when the
        training wheels are kicked off. Curriculums are zero-sum so for
        everything added, something must go; I would rank the following
        topics/courses at least above grade school history, geography, and maybe
        even a second language.

      <h2>How to learn</h2>
      <p>
        Encapsulated by Barbara Oakley's <em>Learning How to Learn</em>. This is
        something that sounds so obvious that everyone assumes they know it
        already&mdash;they don't. The critical practical takeaway is knowledge
        of how learning actually happens and how to take advantage of your own
        psychology. Learning this breaks down the idea that there are subjects
        you are good at and bad at, and replaces it with a set of tools to gain
        mastery in any area.
      </p>
      <h2>Managing your time</h2>
      <p>
        Encapsulated by David Allen's <em>Getting Things Done</em>. Given how
        little attention is paid to time management outside of the corporate
        world, every young adult unfortunately learns this through the "sink or
        swim" approach when transitioning from high school to college and
        <em>again</em> from college to beyond. The big thing here is giving
        students the idea that you can break down big looming projects, in life
        and school, into simple actions they can take immediately. Whether they
        stick to the exact process in the book is inconsequential, what matters
        is instilling the belief that even for the most daunting and ambiguous
        of tasks, there is always a simple next step to take. Otherwise,
        ambiguity can only be tackled when <em>before</em>

        rears its head.
      </p>
      <h2>Reading efficiently and effectively</h2>
      <p>
        Encapsulated by Mortimer J. Adler's <em>How to Read a Book</em>. Forget
        everything you've learned in school about how to read and start over the
        right way; these 400 pages sum up what 12 years of formal education
        could not. If you aren't reading the Table of Contents, you're doing it
        wrong. Students should be able to learn how to <em>quickly</em> get the
        gist of a book and go deeper in the rare instances it's needed. It's
        crazy that we are never taught how to understand the big picture,
        instead spending hours poring over single passages or specific words.
        Once the required reading list goes from two books a semester to 6
        papers and 3 books <em>per class</em>, I'd rather know how to find the
        main message of a book in a few minutes than how to surmise what the
        color green <em>really</em> meant in <em>The Great Gatsby</em>.
