  Last night I couldn't sleep. I felt anxious. A little scared even. But most of
  all... I felt excited. What would another day bring to the epic saga of
  r/wallstreetbets vs "Wall Street"? Would GME continue it's meteoric rise to
  $1000? Would paper hands prevail and bring things tumbling down? Would the mob
  shift to AMC? Would there be a resurgence in one of the old golden children of
  PLTR or TSLA? It was impossible to say and yet the possibilities continued to
  spiral through my mind. Any male between 18-30 was surely thinking the same
  thing: what it would be like to become a literal overnight millionaire?
