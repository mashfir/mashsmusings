  One of the most common pieces of advice is to not get too emotionally invested
  in one company or job. There are many reasons, often out of your control, that
  determine whether or not you may receive an offer. Even if you have some roles
  you are especially excited about, it's important to realize that on some level
  it is always a numbers game. And having multiple offers in hand allows for
  leverage to boost compensation elsewhere and optimize for the best fit. This
  is all extremely reasonable and I regularly give this advice. And yet I have
  confession to make.

  Not for lack of trying mind you, I have cast a wide net many times. I have
  just failed to get more than one which has made decision making pretty
  straightforward. The last bit of this piece of advice reflects that this is
  fine. You don't <em>need</em> to have multiple offers to make a decision and
  it seems counterproductive to let good open offers expire solely for
  optionality or leverage. But casting the net wide is the best way to catch at
  least one fish.
