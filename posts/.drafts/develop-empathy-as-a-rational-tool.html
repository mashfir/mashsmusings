* took the approach of facts, logical arguments, and fallacies to convince
something * if someone did not agree, they were irrational * true rationality
would mean meeting someone at their level to really make your point * I was a
dick, thank you to those who stuck around. charming moniker of 'dream crusher'
by a friend. * conflated a sense of righteousness with a sense of rationality *
to be rational is to understand, be flexible, and correct humbly * to be right
is to fight, be rigid, and break suddenly
