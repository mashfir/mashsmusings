  For most people, the idea of developing technical skills fills them with a
  sense of dread. I can totally relate, until a few years ago the idea of
  someone opening up a terminal would immediately let me know that they're a

  curiosity is to understand the history of things. For example, learning that
  everything you do on your computer or phone these days with clicking around
  windows and apps, used to have to be done with simple text commands simply
  because computers didn't have the power to create fancy graphical elements.
  That clicks the idea that a lot of what you do in a terminal window is simply
  navigate around your folders, move things, edit things, just with some text
  commands instead of mouse clicks.

  find yourself using each day. There is something empowering and exciting about
  learning how to do what you've already done in half the time. You should be
