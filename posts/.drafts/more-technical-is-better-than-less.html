  For most people, the idea of developing technical skills fills them with a
  sense of dread. Up until a few years ago I thought that opening up terminals was only for "hackers" and would feel very overwhelmed any time I had to deal with code. But my advice now is to lean into developing technical skills when possible; when using a tool for 8 hours or more a day, you want to make sure you get the most out of it. In today's age, there is almost no upper limit to how many times more effective you can be by developing these skills. As a new grad with no practical hard skills, I honestly had no sense of what value I could offer. Slowly accumulating those skills helped me figure out what I could offer, what I <em>wanted</em> to offer, and helped me multiply that output.

  Start by diving deeper into the tools you use everyday. If you're in consulting, learn everything you can about PowerPoint, understand how a pro would use the tool. If you're in finance, become a true expert in Excel. You might already be able to accomplish what you need to do day-to-day but as you finish some task, challenge yourself to do it in half the time, or at least half the keystrokes. Learning new skills like coding for the sake of it can be fun and temporarily motivating but the skills quickly disappear without a good use. Gaining mastery of your existing tools on the other hand turns you into an everyday superhero and can lay the foundation for future learnings[0].

  The best way to dispel some of the overwhelming dread and spark some
  curiosity is to understand the history of things. For example, learning that
  everything you do on your computer or phone these days with clicking around
  windows and apps, used to have to be done with simple text commands simply
  because computers didn't have the power to create fancy graphical elements.
  That clicks the idea that a lot of what you do in a terminal window is simply
  navigate around your folders, move things, edit things, just with some text
  commands instead of mouse clicks.

  Stated another way, you should learn the ins and outs of whatever tools you
  find yourself using each day. There is something empowering and exciting about
  learning how to do what you've already done in half the time. You should be
