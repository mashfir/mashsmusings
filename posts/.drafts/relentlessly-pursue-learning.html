<p><em>Relentlessly pursue learning. What you learn is less important.</em></p>
<p>
  If I could only give one piece of career advice, this is it. In recent years,
  this consistent desire to continue learning is how I set myself aside from my
  peers. By focusing solely on learning, you free yourself up from the political
  games and posturing. See others as sources of learning in areas where they
  know something you don't and see them as ways to check your understanding in
  areas where you have something to share.

  What you are learning is less important than ensuring that you are learning
  something that interests you. I have come to learn that knowledge across
  domains builds upon itself, especially if you focus on first principles and
  ideas instead of learning how to imitate. It surprises people to learn that I
  read fiction and yet I probably read more fiction than anything else. Any
  <em>good</em> book will teach you something or give you pause to wonder about
  your beliefs; most great fiction is simply philosophy wrapped in a narrative
  structure.

  It is okay to not always have the energy to learn and at times there will be
  more important things to worry about. But if you find yourself lost about what
  you want to learn or worse, have no desire to learn, take a step back to find
  something. Money can be a rough measure of how much you've learned and what
  that's worth but optimizing for money is the ultimate trap. As stated in
  Goodhart's law:

  When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.
