I recently read a funny blog post on things learned way too late in life. While there are certainly no shortage of such things to share, I find some of my most "woah" moments have been related to the world of computing. As a relatively new and very informal student of computing, I am constantly met with revelation at all of the things which I never understood or maybe just got wrong. But once you figure them out, the lightbulb just goes off. Here are a few:

1. Clients, servers, hosts, oh my...
At risk of sounding trite, it's important to state that these are all just computers! Sometimes it's your computer, sometimes it's someone else's, sometimes it's a special computer, but just imagine a plain old desktop in your head and you'll get the concept just fine.

It turns out that computing is hard and computing people are weirdly into food analogies. Perhaps this is to make things relatable, perhaps it's because they love food, who knows.

Whenever you interact with a computer network, you are trying to get or give something to the network -- after all why are you on the network? Imagine the network like a strip of restaurants. When browsing, you, the client, decide you want something from the restaurant, your host. You the client, make a request to the server, and the server fetches you the item and serves it up to you for consumption. That's it!

## File extensions are just hints to other programs
Have you ever had the experience of renaming a file when you get the scary prompt about changing the file extension? I always had the sense that I was breaking something and that to click yes meant to irrevocably corrupt my poor file. Turns out that all the file extension does is just give other programs a clue as to what's in the file, it doesn't actually contain any data itself! Try writing a simple hello.txt file and changing it to hello.jpeg. Unfortunately that does not have the magic effect of turning your text file into a snapshot of text, it just confuses Paint when you try to open it. Good thing is, you can always go back.

## Buttons and windows on your OS can always go back to CLI

## Domains are read backwards
Whenever I visit something like www.google.com, as an English speaker, I read it and interpret it as www dot google dot com, which seems reasonable to interpret as "Go to the worldwide web, then go to Google, and then the .com version". This pattern is reinforced by thinking of www.google.ca which follows the same pattern but instead says "actually, go to the Canadian version instead".

Confusingly this is totally backwards, domains are actually read backwards. The .com or .ca that we think of as the patriotic appendage is in fact the Top Level Domain. google is merely one subdomain within the space of .com or .ca. And every . thereafter denotes deeper levels of subdomains. Weird right!?

Well where does that leave our www? Is www merely a subdomain of com dot google? Yes! It is in fact just a cosmetic thing that is a vestige of historical convention. In practice this explains why you can always drop the cosmetic www. appendage in any domain but you can never drop the .com.

Reading my domain makes a lot more sense when viewed this way. The Organization called Neocities is hosting a small slice pointing to Mash's Musings. org dot neocities dot mashsmusings!

As for the stuff that comes after the /? You can think of those as folders except now we're going in the opposite direction. If you think of just the domain as pointing to the highest up, root, parent folder on a computer, you can think of each / as clicking into a folder within that computer. So clicking on a single post takes you to the blogs folder under my mashsmusings subdomain and gives you the specific post stored in that folder.

The beginning part of the URL tells the client how the stuff will be served. This is kind of complicated.
