  If you take the last piece of advice seriously, compensation should be an
  afterthought. It is sufficiently challenging to determine professional
  interests and match that with potential roles. Optimize with only that in mind
  and you minimize the chance of day-to-day misery. Switching roles primarly
  based on compensation (or prestige) is the surest form of self-sabotage. If
  you're unlucky enough to succeed, you will quickly realize that there are
  still people making multiples of what you're making and the insecurity
  resumes.

  Salaries are almost completely meaningless in the abstract as a measure of
  your success in a specific pursuit. And titles are only a coarse clue to what
  a role entails. If your goals follow such a pattern then the best advice I can
  offer is to question what you really enjoy in life. What the activities are
  that you find yourself losing sleep over in a good way.

  That said, you should never leave money on the table. Once you've finished all
  your interview prep, it is time to gather as much information as possible
  about compensation. All comp numbers are in some sense arbitrary. This does
  not mean that anything is possible, but this does mean that there is always
  room on the table to get more. Ask people working there if you feel
  comfortable, many people are willing to discuss if you ask for the right
  reasons. If not, scour the web for comp at similar companies, similar roles,
  or senior roles and determine what is truly possible. I am not an expert in
  negotiation and there are good resources specifically for that if you're
  interested. But know that there is always some room if you are willing to have
  that uncomfortable conversation. It's okay to not be excited because of comp
  but make sure you weigh that against the initial excitement from fit.

<p>
  Once you've signed or settled into a promotion, repeat. That is, ignore
  compensation until the next milestone. Constantly worrying about comp and
  trying to compare against others is a guaranteed recipe for discontent.
