  Perhaps the real advice here is two-fold. First, do not apply to roles which
  don't excite you. If none of the roles you're applying to seem exciting, try
  and chat with at least one person roughly your age to get a sense of what
  motivates them. If you're still not excited, consider a new field of work. And
  if nothing seems appealing, as is often the case in school, take a step back
  to think about what you enjoy. And really resolve to talk to someone making a
  living doing that thing. Eventually, you'll find something. Sometimes it's
  just okay to be excited about getting a job, that counts too[1].

  Second, bask in the sense of gratitude and excitement that comes from
  receiving an offer. Let yourself be excited, don't trivialize the achievement.
  Too often I see people with multiple fantastic offers whittling away the
  excitement by comparing downsides and even weighing which option will be
  better for their <em>next</em> move, before even starting this one. If you are
  not excited by the immediate prospect of doing the role, you are not excited.
  Go back to the last paragraph.

  Knowing my previous confession, this advice often appears hypocritical. Having
  always taken the first offer given me, how can I advise others to only take
  those that excite them? And yet I can wholeheartedly say that I have been
  excited about every role I've taken. I remember being over the moon at landing
  an admin assistant role at 18 paying minimum wage as it was an "office job"
  and involved meeting other "working" students.
