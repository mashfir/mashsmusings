<title>Emergence of religious values</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>
  Over the last few years, fueled in part by curiosity and in part by the search
  for the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything,
  I have tried implementing a variety of lifestyle changes. Most of these ideas
  have come from separate sources and some have stuck more than others (I swear
  I'll start working out everyday tomorrow). But taking a step back on some of
  the more impactful ones paints an eerily familiar picture:
</p>
<ol id="habits">
  <li>
    <em>Rarely drink or do drugs.</em> Inspired by my hatred of weekends spent
    recovering from hangovers and by examples set by two friends enjoying the same
    parties.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Abstain from porn and masturbation.</em> Inspired by that one
    <a href="https://vid.puffyan.us/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU" target="_blank"
      >TEDx Talk</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Meditate first thing in the morning and often before bed.</em> Inspired
    by Sam Harris.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Rarely eat meat.</em> Inspired by a course in air pollution engineering
    and a long-time partner.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Read philosophy and religious texts.</em> Inspired by desire to find the
    Answer and catch up on
    <a href="/posts/dont-read-what-others-are-reading.html" target="_blank"
      >literary tradition</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Rarely lie.</em> Inspired by Sam Harris and a long-time partner. I would
    say I never lie but...
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Tithe.</em> Inspired by a SEO savvy career quiz that led me to
    <a href="https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/" target="_blank">80,000 Hours</a>
    and
    <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org" target="_blank"
      >Giving What We Can</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Reduce amount of "stuff".</em> Inspired by anxiety around clutter and
    desire to save more.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Intermittently fast.</em> Inspired by David Sinclair's
    <em>Lifespan</em>.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The clear religious parallels bent of this list would outdo many Muslims I know. Yet my belief in a traditional God is no stronger than it was
  before. In
  fact I'd wager that the intense angst and atheist identity formed in my
  teenage years probably made me more resistant to these ideas than most. But
  here we are. Like the final zoom out on
  <a href="https://vid.puffyan.us/watch?v=IceiU-Wmnog" target="_blank"
    >Art Attack</a
  >, it is surprising how a series of small unrelated steps looks from a big
  picture lens.
</p>
<p>
  Does this mean the seemingly arbitrary rules handed down by religions are really some
  emergent properties that arise from one's search for truth and
  contentment? If so, does that justify the use of more persuasive tools such as
  fear and shame to keep others on the path?
</p>
<p>
  While I leave you to ponder the former, I draw a hard line against the latter.
  It is easy, in hindsight, to preach about virtues, but applying pressure
  wantonly does more harm than good. For me, each of these habits came from the
  right conversation at the right time. And the only real teacher was lived
  experience.
</p>
<p>
  More insidiously, packaging virtues with negative emotions can backfire in a
  spectacular way. Discovered individually and independently, virtues serve as a
  rock solid foundation for identity; but handed down from God, the slightest
  tremor can cause the house of cards to topple into crisis. Inoculation means
  bottom-up learning. And bottom-up learning means making your own mistakes.

<title>Don't read what others are reading</title>
<guid>https://mashsmusings.neocities.org/index.html#dont-read-what-others-are-reading</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 22:12:23 -0700</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>
  In a couple of recent discussions with friends around books to read and
  suggestions, I drew some ire around my stance on recommendations and book
  clubs&mdash;I am not open to contemporary or topical books. This draws
  criticism without fail and yet my conviction on this has only strengthened.
</p>
<p>
One compelling argument is summarized well in a Farnam Street <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/04/reading-what-everyone-else-is-reading/" target="_blank">blog
  post</a>:
</p>
<blockquote
  id="reading-everyone-else-reading"
  cite="https://fs.blog/2013/04/reading-what-everyone-else-is-reading/"
>
  If we&#39;re reading what everyone else is reading it&#39;s harder to think
  differently about problems, decisions, or life.
</blockquote>
<p>
  There is definitely an element of truth to this but, as my friend pointed out,
  the Murakami quote around the other boys being crap is elitist at best. While this vague call to a sense of independence is appealing, there is a much better reason to focus on classics.
</p>
<p>
  As Adler points out in <em>How to Read a Book</em>, the reason to read
  classics is not to feel &quot;cultured&quot;&mdash;it's to understand the rich
  literary tradition behind everything we know. One cannot really understand the
  significance of <em>Reading Lolita in Tehran</em> without first reading
  <em>Lolita</em>. Or truly walk with Dante through Hell without knowing of
  Virgil.  And this lack of understanding is often much worse in nonfiction. People nowadays
  praise Piketty's
  <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> with no knowledge of Marx's
  <em>Capital</em>, which Piketty is transparently trying to build upon. And of
  the few socialists who have actually read Marx, almost none have read Adam
  Smith, whose theories Marx was rebutting. To read only contemporary books is
  to spend your life skating on the tips of icebergs, blind to the centuries of
  thought that have led us to where we are today.
</p>
<p>
  Accepting this truth is one thing, but acting on it is another. This path can
  seem extremely daunting, once you start looking for predecessor after
  predecessor, you realize it's turtles all the way down. And that realization
  can be demotivating enough to justify abandoning the pursuit altogether.
  Fortunately, there are
  <a
    href="https://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/great-books-reading-list"
    >some</a
  >
  excellent
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_a_Book#Reading_list_(1972_edition)"
    >reading lists</a
  >
  out there that help stop the infinite regress. While it would take many
  lifetimes to traverse the entire iceberg of human knowledge, you'll be
  surprised to see how far along you'll get simply by reading
  <em>The Odyssey</em> or <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em>.
</p>
<p>As the ancient Chinese proverb goes:</p>
<blockquote id="journey-of-a-thousand-steps">
  A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
</blockquote>
<p>
  So dear reader, try taking that first step. Once you cross the chasm from
  Heather's Picks to Homer's Picks, you'll never look back.

<title>Dos and Dont's of Feynman</title>
<guid>https://mashsmusings.neocities.org/index.html#dos-and-donts-of-feynman</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 16:11:46 -0700</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>
  I recently finished reading <em>"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman"</em> and
  found his life to be often profound, sometimes cringe, and consistently
  wonderful. Here is my ranking of some of his advice.
</p>
<h2>Words to live by</h2>
<p>
  Above all else, always focus on <em>true</em> understanding. The kind which
  you get from experiencing, teaching others, and extrapolating beyond the
  homework. This idea was best summed up by an analogy in which he blasts the
  Brazilian physics program for its emphasis on volume and rote. Unfortunately,
  the style of education on blast has become the norm.
</p>
<blockquote id="greek-scholar">
  <p>
    Then I gave the analogy of a Greek scholar who loves the Greek language, who
    knows that in his own country there aren't many children studying Greek. But
    he comes to another country, where he is delighted to find everybody
    studying Greek&mdash;even the smaller kids in elementary schools. He goes to
    the examination of a student who is coming to get his degree in Greek, and
    asks him, &quot;What were Socrates' ideas on the relationship between Truth
    and Beauty?&quot;&mdash;and the student can't answer. Then he asks the
    student, &quot;What did Socrates say to Plato in the Third Symposium?&quot;
    the student lights up and goes, &quot;<em>Brrrrrrrrr-up</em>&quot;&mdash;he
    tells you everything, word for word, that Socrates said, in beautiful Greek.
  </p>
  <p>
    But what Socrates was talking about in the Third Symposium was the
    relationship between Truth and Beauty!
  </p>
  <p>
    What this Greek scholar discovers is, the students in another country learn
    Greek by first learning to pronounce the letters, then the words, and then
    sentences and paragraphs. They can recite, word for word, what Socrates
    said, without eralizing that those Greek words actually
    <em>mean</em> something. To the student they are all artificial sounds.
    Nobody has ever translated them into words the student can understand.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try and understand the phenomena itself instead of just the word.</p>
<blockquote id="just-a-word">
  <p>
    The answer was, for the wind-up toy, &quot;Energy makes it go.&quot; And for
    the boy on the bicycle, &quot;Energy makes it go.&quot; For everything,
    &quot;<em>Energy</em> makes it go.&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that doesn't <em>mean</em> anything... The child doesn't learn anything;
    it's just a <em>word</em>!
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make sure you have a real example to test your understanding.</p>
<blockquote id="physical-example">
  He thinks I'm following the steps mathematically, but that's not what I'm
  doing. I have the specific, physical example of what he's trying to analyze,
  and I know from instinct and experience the properties of the thing.
</blockquote>
<p>It is foolish to seek the wisdom of the crowd.</p>
<blockquote id="emperor-of-china">
  This question of trying to figure out whether a book is good or bad by looking
  at it carefully or by taking the reports of a lot of people who looked at it
  carelessly is like this famous old problem: Nobody was permitted to see the
  Emperor of China, and the question was, What is the length of the Emperor of
  China's nose? To find out, you go all over the country asking people what they
  think the length of the Emperor of China's nose is, and you
  <em>average</em> it. And that would be very "accurate" because you averaged so
  many people. But it's no way to find anything out; when you have a very wide
  range of pople who contribute without looking carefully at it, you don't
  improve your knowledge of the situation by averaging.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Reflect on the value of what it is you're achieving. It's easy to get caught
  up in the joy of achievement.
</p>
<blockquote id="bob-wilson">
  <p>
    After the [atomic bomb test] went off, there was tremendous excitement at
    Los Alamos. Everybody had parties, we all ran around. I sat on the end of a
    jeep and beat drums and so on. But one man, I remember, Bob Wilson, was just
    sitting there moping.
  </p>
  <p>I said, &quot;What are you moping about?&quot;</p>
  <p>He said, &quot;It's a terrible thing that we made.&quot;</p>
  <p>I said, &quot;But you started it. You got us into it.&quot;</p>
  <p>
    You see, what happened to me&mdash;what happened to the rest of us&mdash;is
    we <em>started</em> for a good reason, then you're working very hard to
    accomplish something and it's a pleasure, it's excitement. And you stop
    thinking, you know; you just <em>stop</em>. Bob Wilson was the only one who
    was still thinking about it, in that moment.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Dos</h2>
<ol id="dos">
  <li>Make learning fun. You won't get very far otherwise.</li>
  <li>
    "I learned that innovation is a very difficult thing in the real world."
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't overestimate your competition. You never know when the fifty person
    chemistry team you're competing against turns out to be just Feynman and a
    bottle-washer.
  </li>
  <li>
    "Learn what the rest of the world is like. The variety is worthwhile."
  </li>
  <li>
    Be afraid when you find yourself wanting to drink or do drugs spontaneously.
  </li>
  <li>
    "To be a practical man was, to me, always somehow a positive virtue, and to
    be 'cultured' or 'intellectual' was not. The first was right, of course, but
    the second was crazy."
  </li>
  <li>
    "I've very often made mistakes in physics by thinking the theory isn't as
    good as it really is, thinking that there are lots of complications that are
    going to spoil it&mdash;an attitude that anything can happen, in spite of
    what you're pretty sure should happen."
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't worry about how esteemed anyone is in conversation, worry only about
    your ability to reason through the matter at hand. That's the type of person
    who the esteemed surround themselves with.
  </li>
  <li>
    Feynman on imposter syndrome: "You know, what they think of you is so
    fantastic, it's impossible to live up to it. You have no responsibility to
    live up to it!"
  </li>
  <li>
    "When you're young, you have all these things to worry about&mdash;should
    you go there, what about your mother. And you worry, and try to decide, but
    then something else comes up. It's much easier to just plain
    <em>decide</em>. Never mind&mdash;<em>nothing</em> is going to change your
    mind."
  </li>
  <li>
    When asked about his experience at an interdisciplinary conference on the
    "ethics of equality": "This conference was worse than a Rorschach test.
    There's a meaningless inkblot, and the others ask you what you think you
    see, but when you tell them, they start arguing with you!"
  </li>
  <li>
    On grading elementary school textbooks: "The definitions weren't accurate.
    Everything was a little bit ambiguous&mdash;they weren't
    <em>smart</em> enough to understand what was meant by 'rigor.' They were
    faking it. They were teaching something they didn't understand, and which
    was, in fact, <em>useless</em>, at that time, for the child.
  </li>
  <li>
    "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself&mdash;and you are
    the easiest person to fool."
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Proceed with caution</h2>
<ol id="caution">
  <li>Pursuing lucid dreaming for sexual excitement.</li>
  <li>
    As a professor, asking students at your university to pose nude for your
    drawings.
  </li>
  <li>Accepting a brothel owner's commission for a nude drawing.</li>
  <li>Testifying in court about the merits of a topless dancing bar.</li>
  <li>Going into a sensory deprivation chamber for 2.5 hrs on ketamine.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Don'ts</h2>
<ol id="donts">
  <li>
    Crawling around your floor trying to see you can smell your own footprints.
  </li>
  <li>
    Driving straight back to work after your wife's death and telling your

  </li>
  <li>Getting into bar fights in Buffalo.</li>

    Picking up a girl by unironically telling her, "You...are worse than a

<title>Sports are dumb</title>
<guid>https://mashsmusings.neocities.org/index.html#sports-are-dumb</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 08:46:28 -0700</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>
  I'd imagine most people reading the title are either relieved to finally hear
  what they haven't been allowed to say their whole lives or are already coming
  up with answers for why I'm wrong. I'm not talking about lowercase sports, the
  games we play for fun, fitness, and competition. I am saying that Sports
  &mdash; the televised media phenomenon involving following favorite teams,
  tracking stats, and arguing about players &mdash; are dumb.
</p>
<p>
  There is an element of this which I think nobody will disagree with. Everyone
  at some level is aware that how many times someone throws a ball through a
  hoop or carries a ball past a painted line doesn't matter. And yet, people
  defend their love for Sports with a passion.
</p>
<p>
  People often argue that their passion for Sports stems from their passion to
  see people reach pinnacles of human achievement and athleticism. But if this
  were the only or main reason, we would expect the most useful or relatable
  proficiencies to be the most highly esteemed. The fact that you know the names
  of more basketball players on a single team than you do master carpenters,
  ultramarathoners, and memory athletes combined should prove that this love for
  achievement is not the key factor.
</p>
<p>
  Sports are a societally acceptable and even virtuous way to connect with
  others and have fun. But at some point we find ourselves transformed from
  spectator to sports fan. When the outcome of the next shot starts triggering
  an emotional response, the player or the team becomes a part of our identity.
  And this identification with and glorification of Sports is where the heart of
  the issue lies.
</p>
<p>
  What we tie our identities to, and thus what ends up getting elevated to
  celebrity status in society, is a reflection of our values. Ambitiously, we
  can think of values such as pushing the frontiers of human achievement or
  seeking fundamental truths. More simply, we can think of values such as living
  a healthy life or fostering loving relationships. But what values are
  reflected when we tie our identity to competition over useless games based on
  geographical location?
</p>
<p>
  While this seems like a scathing review of Sports, I actually don't have a
  problem with just watching sports. Have fun and enjoy the spectacle of seeing
  giant superhumans dunk rubber balls! Just take a step back to reflect the next
  time you find yourself upset about a certain team losing or arguing about what
  a player ought to have done. What is it you really care about?

<title>Stick to one club</title>
<guid>https://mashsmusings.neocities.org/index.html#stick-to-one-club</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 08:42:37 -0700</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[
      <h1>
        <a href="/posts/stick-to-one-club.html">Stick to one club</a>
      </h1>
      <h4>Published Apr. 5, 2021</h4>
      <p><em>Stick to one club. Passion stems from honing a skill.</em></p>
      <p>
        Through most of my schooling, I was almost never involved in
        extracurricular activities. Growing up, I chalked this up to my parents'
        haughty attitude towards such things and the constant refrain that
        studying was all that mattered. But reflecting on my
        <a href="/posts/do-one-thing.html" target="_blank">previous post</a>, I
        realize that there was more at play.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a steady stream of trying out what was "cool" or "strategic"
        such as basketball, Model UN, DECA, or FSAE but then dropping out after
        the first couple weeks when the novelty wore off and I realized that I
        wasn't very good. People talked about finding your passion and so I
        surmised that because I was not passionate about these activities, I
        should drop them. What nobody told me was that passion is found
        <em>by building competency</em> and not the other way around. By
        quitting everything which I didn't naturally excel at, I kept eluding
        the very thing I was chasing. It was not until starting a full-time job,
        in which quitting wasn't really an option, that I started to see the joy
        of developing a craft, regardless of what that craft is. Suddenly I
        found myself interested in things I'd never thought about in my life
        such as graphic design, public speaking, and data analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        We often poke fun at "sellout" careers such as accountant or management
        consultant. "Who ever grows up wanting to be an accountant?", we jest.
        Now don't get me wrong, having met plenty of accountants and
        consultants, I can confirm that there are no shortage of sellouts and
        people "playing it safe". But what's missed is the large number of
        people who <em>found</em> their passion as they honed their craft,
        something that those repeating the tired trope likely have not
        experienced.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hidden beauty of a club or profession is the sense of community that
        comes from surrounding yourself with people dedicated to honing the same
        craft. Through competition and camaraderie, the spark of passion grows
        into a flame. Seeming trivialities such as accounting exams or tech
        conferences become rites of passage and hotbeds of learning. So much
        depth becomes available in the simple exercise of coming to terms with
        your own incompetence. Stick to one club. Passion stems from honing a
        skill.

<title>Do one thing</title>
<guid>https://mashsmusings.neocities.org/index.html#do-one-thing</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 04 Apr 2021 14:42:20 -0700</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>
  <em>Do one thing at a time. Stop multitasking, it's a lie.</em>
</p>
<p>
  One of the worst habits I had built up was trying to do more at
  once, thinking that this was the key to productivity. This
  idea even pervaded into relaxation where listening to music, reading, chatting
  with friends, watching TV were more often done in concert than alone or even
  in pairs. And my god what a cacaphony that was. What
  <em>felt</em> like speeding at 100 mph through the climax of
  <em>Limitless</em>, was really my brain working on overdrive to complete the most
  mundane tasks with minimum comprehension. Unfortunately, my
  psyche finds the intensity of the overstimulation to be far more addictive
  than the sobering reality of how half-hearted my messages were or the
  inability to recall which songs had played for the last 30 minutes.
</p>
<p>
  Overcoming that addiction to stimulation is a Herculean task. Like the hydra,
  two new notifications or recommendations pop up for every one we are able to
  ignore, leading to that all too familiar fatigue on the other side of a YouTube black hole.
  And yet, we're all aware of the perfect contentment, even bliss, that comes
  from concentrated focus. I'd urge my younger self to think about the
  conversations with friends where the rising sun was the only reminder of how
  much time had passed. To think about the twilight hours before an exam when stress finally took over and problem sets
  started melting away. I'd urge him to answer honestly which moments
  truly resembled happiness and productivity.
</p>
<p>
  While this realization would have been no panacea for distraction, it would
  have at least served to dispel the myth of multitasking. That it was not just
  an inability to multitask correctly but a misguided pursuit altogether. And in
  that dispelling provide at least a moment of clarity on what is really worth
  pursuing. Do one thing at a time. Stop multitasking, it's a lie.

  <em>Go to class. Don't worry about notes or what you miss. Just show up.</em>
</p>
<p>
  One of my top regrets in life is my abysmal class attendance in university.
  I'd imagine a plot of my class attendance vs time would look almost like a
  perfectly straight line from 100% in the first few months of freshman year to
  20% in the final months of senior year. The regret does not stem from the lost
  GPA but rather the lost learning. I can already see my younger self rolling
  his eyes and mentally checking out. And as this is a directive for that
  younger self, this seems like a lost cause. But bear with me, since I think
  there is something that younger me missed.
</p>
<p>
  Going to class is the best way to passively learn and collect extra GPA. Like
  reading, going to class gets built up as this great virtuous activity; one
  that requires the utmost attention, pre-reads, furious note-taking, and
  questions that are 9 parts flexing your understanding to the other 150 kids:1
  part clarification. And yes, those will all absolutely enrich the experience.
  But the beauty of class is that you still gain something with absolutely none
  of that.
</p>
<p>
  As mentioned in Mortimer J. Adler's condescendingly yet aptly-named
  <em>How to Read a Book</em>, it's important to get the gist of a book before
  really analyzing it. On the first pass, focus on what you do understand,
  instead of what you don't. This seemingly simple advice contradicts most of
  schooling where you can't progress until you understand. And I think this
  simple shift in focus, away from frantic dictation to a laidback absorption of
  occasional insight, is what's missed. The rest can (but probably won't) come
  later. Take the freebies while you can. Go to class. Don't worry about notes
  or what you miss. Just show up.

<title>Just keep reading</title>

    >Just keep reading. Doesn't matter what, doesn't matter when, doesn't matter
    for how long. Just keep reading.</em

</p>
<p>
  I, like most people my age, used to <em>love</em> reading as a kid. Like
  seriously love it. To the point where my mom would have to come take away my
  flashlight after a new <em>Artemis Fowl</em> or <em>Harry Potter</em> book
  came out so I wouldn't stay up all night reading. And yet, as I grew up and
  video games got fancier, broadband internet entered our home, and the
  nightmarish social pressures of puberty became a thing, I forgot about
  reading. It wasn't a strong conviction or anything, it just simply faded away.
  Reading became an activity for school, not for fun. And then at some point
  reading became a virtue, a painful rite of passage to show how smart you were.
</p>
<p>
  As a result, it took me a full decade to start reading again. And many months
  after that before I started reading for fun. Ten years of learnings gone,
  emotions not experienced, perspectives unchallenged. It was a quote from Naval
  Ravikant that made me realize what I got wrong 10 years ago.
</p>
<blockquote cite="https://nav.al/love-read">
  Everybody I know who reads a lot loves to read, and they love to read because
  they read books that they loved. It’s a little bit of a catch-22, but you
  basically want to start off just reading wherever you are and then keep
  building up from there until reading becomes a habit. And then eventually, you
  will just get bored of the simple stuff.
</blockquote>
<p>
  There were plenty of books that I loved to read but at some point that seemed
  like the wrong thing to do. Reading for fun was no longer cool and then over
  time, it became a big thing. A reminder to drop the pretense and just pick up
  a book, any book, when I'm restless or on vacation would have been great. Keep
  the habit, embrace the guilty reads! Just keep reading. Doesn't matter what,
  doesn't matter when, doesn't matter for how long. Just keep reading.

<title>Directives for a younger self</title>
<guid>https://mashsmusings.neocities.org/index.html#directives-for-a-younger-self</guid>

  Every time I read the work of wunderkinder like Vitalik Buterin or Patrick
  Collison, I find myself awestruck by what they had accomplished at such a
  young age. During the time in which they were reading cryptography papers and
  great Western classics, I was busy organizing drop parties in Varrock and PQs
  in Kerning City. Take Patrick's
  <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/advice" target="_blank">advice</a> for
  10-20 year olds for example. How many 10 year olds could actually internalize
  this? I'm not even sure that I was thinking on this level at 20 and can only
  hope to get there at 30.
</p>
<p>
  This stark difference has made me wonder what advice <em>would</em> have
  reached through to an obstinate arrogant younger me. While I don't think I
  could have convinced that self to read esoteric books or practice meditation,
  I do think that simple
  <a href="https://sive.rs/2do" target="_blank">directives</a> summarizing the
  lessons could have piqued some curiosity. And so, the next few posts will be
  my attempt at collecting some of these directives.
</p>
<p>Directive #1: Always listen to your future self.</p>

  <p>
  You ease into your booth for a cup of coffee with friends. It took a bit of convincing to get people to switch cafes but you’re finally here: WhatsCup. You’re aware of all the cameras overhead watching your every move and you know it’s still owned by Facebucks, the same parent company as the last cafe, but hey, at least the cameras here are closed-circuit and there are no hidden microphones at the tables. It’s to help serve you better you’re reassured.
  </p>

  <p>
  “Another iced WhatsFrapp with the whip cream on the side?”, the barista asks.
  </p>

  <p>
  You nod suspiciously; they’ve been tracking your purchases. But hey, it makes for more personalized service and at least there are no god damn mics at the table.
  </p>

  <p>
  A few months pass and you catch a glimpse of <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">a new notice</a> by the entrance. Starting next month, all the footage and data will be shared with the rest of Facebucks. Who you talk to, when you visit, what you ordered — everything is now shared. There's no mention of an opt out. And what about the armies of third-parties Facebucks is affiliated with? You have to squint to read the fine print. It’s all shared with third parties as well. All to help serve you better you’re reassured. “Your privacy is our priority” it states boldly.
  </p>

  <p>
  “Didn’t I say no to this a few years back? What about the the sign reading ‘<a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/privacy/" target="_blank">You control your privacy</a>’?”, you ask.
  </p>

  <p>
  You think you hear the camera overhead zoom in a little but you’re not sure.
  </p>

  <p>
  “Management”, the barista shrugs apologetically, “Can I get you another iced WhatsFrapp?”
  </p>

  <p>
  You look down the street at <a href="https://signal.org" target="_blank">Sig & Nal’s</a>. It’s a nonprofit with a 4.8 star rating and prides itself on just serving you and your friends coffee by donation; no cameras, no tracking. They even have the building plans available for anyone to verify.
  </p>

  <p>
  You look back at your friends settling into the usual booth, unfazed, and the sea of cameras silently watching overhead. What do you do?

<title>Don't know thyself</title>

  <p>
  When discussing the topic of change or trying something new, I often hear the refrain, “I know myself, I wouldn't like X” or, “I'm not a Y person”. And while there is much wisdom and value in the old aphorism of “know thyself”, I think we would all stand to benefit by knowing ourselves a little less.
  </p>
  <p>
  As Yuval Noah Harari summarizes in Sapiens, humankind has been driven by shared, often subconscious, narratives. And while these narratives have enabled us to send people to the Moon, they have also served as the backbone of every bloody war. And while it can be easy to unsubscribe from shared narratives, it's important to realize that there are a great many <em>internal</em> narratives we carry as well. And similarly, our internal narratives can bring out the best and the worst in us.
  </p>
  For example, throughout most of my life I had a crystal clear, staunch understanding—nay a <em>fact</em>!— about myself, that I was not “a morning person”. What exactly “a morning person” was I did not know but I was certain that my 4:00 am – 12:00 pm sleep schedule in university certainly disqualified me from consideration. Fast-forward a couple years and after being in a situation in which I could enjoy a nice hot breakfast and flat white only if I woke up before 6:30 am (early birds do get the worms after all), I decided that the alone time and free meal were worth an earlier alarm. Seemingly overnight, I started to hear all my coworkers say how <em>they</em> could never do the same because they were not morning people. How could this be when I was not a morning person either? What had changed? All I had done was tap my phone a couple times to dial my alarm back.
  <p>
  Simply put, I just let go of a narrative. I learned that my “I'm not a morning person” narrative was as bogus as my childhood “I'm a boy and boys like cars” narrative. What took precedence was the narrative of “Of course I can do this”, a less confining and yet equally self-fulfilling mantra. And loosening this rigid sense of identity has led to so many (generally positive) changes that I'm left considering the ship of Theseus and how illusory this whole identity thing was to start with.
  </p>
  <p>
  So next time you're faced with a positive change that seems way out of character, don't “know thyself”. Take a second to think of whether the change aligns with who you <em>want to be</em> instead of who you <em>are</em>. And then simply try. You'll inevitably wake up at 1:00 pm on a weekend but that's okay. Drop the “I'm failure” story and just try again tomorrow. You'll be surprised at who you can be when you stop trying to be who you are.

<title>Demystifying the logistic regression equation</title>

</h1>
<h4>
  Published Oct. 1, 2020
</h4>
<div>
  <p>
  After thinking about the whole logistic regression thing for a while, I was confused how we got to the magic e^x function considering our goal was merely to go from a crude linear approximation of a probability to a meaningful probability bounded between 0 and 1. While there are infinitely many ways to get there, <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tbgpkcxa0l">here</a> are a few arguably simpler examples I came up with to also achieve the same outcome. Notably, I was curious why we do we not use the x/abs(x) version when that gives us a much crisper binary outcome?[0]
  </p>

  <img src="/images/sigmoid-graphs.png" alt="graphs" width="500px" />

  <p>
  The problem breaks down into answering the following:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>How can we make sure our output is positive?</li>
    <li>And how can we make sure our output is bounded at 1?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
  But thinking about this, we can see that there are infinitely many ways to do this. So again, why an exponential?
  </p>
  <p>
  I can come up with intuitions that help us understand why we use the equation we use[1]:
  An exponential reflects the idea that an increase in X result in an increase in p(X) and a decrease in X results in a decrease in p(X). In other words, a negative coefficient means a decrease in probability and vice versa.[2] 
  </p>
  <p>
  Exponentials? :check:  Lines? :check: Squares? :x: Absolute? :x:
  </p>
  <p>
  An exponential, by definition, reflects the idea that the effect a step change in X has on p(X) depends on our current value of X.[3] In other words, if we’re considering the effect of income on probability of default, it matters whether we are going from an income of $0k–$10k vs $200k–$210k.
  </p>
  <p>
  Exponentials? :check:  Lines? :x: Squares? :check:  Absolute? :x:
  </p>
  <p>
  And what about the +1 in the denominator? We could have used any number > 0. It seems 1 is just a convenient choice to help give meaning to p(X) / (1-p(X)). We could just as correctly use +2 or +3, but then we would just be carrying around a factor of 2 or 3. So we just pick +1 arbitrarily to make things simpler.
  </p>
  <p>
  Hopefully these ramblings kind of help understand the seemingly magical appearance of e^x in this application. As with a lot of other statistical applications, the formula chosen is due to thoughtful convenience and not an absolute truth.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <p>
  [0] You can just as legitimately use x/abs(x) to create your own binary classifier.
  </p>
  <p>
  [1] These may not be the actual reasons why this equation was chosen…
  </p>
  <p>
  [2] I guess this really just means that we want dy/dx > 0 for all x?
  </p>
  <p>
  [3] I guess this really just means that we want d^2y/dx^2 ≠ 0?
  </p>
