      <h4>Published Jun. 5, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        As a painfully honest joke in consulting went, "Do something once and
        you're sold as a practitioner, do something twice and you're sold as an
        expert." Recently, I became an expert in book clubs. Based on that
        expertise and extensive market research (discussions with friends), I am
        here to publish some best practices on how to conduct your own book
        club.
      </p>
      <ul id="book-club-tips">
        <li>
          Align on objectives. Is your book club merely a pretense for wine
          night with the girls? A way to affect social change? Or to
          <s
            >rip through classics well over your reading level to flex on
            peers</s
          >
          steep yourself in literary history? All of these reasons are
          separately valid but I would advise against putting a wannabe
          philosopher-king in a room with Karen from work looking to unwind on a
          Saturday night.
        </li>
        <li>
          Decide on a pace and stick to it. This is what separates being in a
          book club from telling your friends that you're in a book club. Think
          about how much time you would normally spend reading in a week and
          assume maybe half of that will go into your book club. It's easy to
          get overly ambitious here, nobody really wants to raise their hand as
          the slow reader. But trust me, everyone going at the same pace is much
          better than showing up with a handful of excuses and some extra wine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that you <em>could</em> have a political discussion with the
          members. Whether you're reading
          <em>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</em> or <em>Das Kapital</em>, the
          discussion will inevitably veer towards life and society. If you can't
          have open contentious discussion with these people, your book club
          probably won't end well. The biggest trap here is not necessarily
          having different political views but not viewing someone else as an
          intellectual equal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Choose the right book. This seems obvious and should follow from the
          objectives but this crucial step can feel like a UN General Assembly.
          If there's not a clear book that inspired the idea in the first place,
          start with a general theme, find a general time period, and go from
          there. When in doubt, <em>don't</em> go for

      <h4>Published Jun. 2, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        At a recent talk at work, the speaker off-handedly mentioned something
        that stuck with me:
      </p>
      <blockquote id="looking-back">
        If I don't look back at my work a year from now and think it was crap,
        then I should probably be in management.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This guy is currently an individual contributor (IC) but had spent
        enough time as an engineering manager that this comment was not entirely
        tongue-in-cheek. The idea is that ICs should be improving themselves
        sufficiently to question previous work. In my conversations with other
        ICs, I have found this to be almost universally true. The more ambitious
        the person, the more crap things look in hindsight!
      </p>
      <p>
        I first noticed this almost exactly a year after starting full-time
        work. From slides to presentation style to spreadsheets, I cringed at
        almost everything I had put out. One year later and that still held
        true. Whether it's in the approach taken or simply the speed of
        execution, the glances in the rearview mirror continue to be ugly.
        Progress is a funny thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now in some ways this might seem obvious. Absolute improvement in a
        given domain probably follows an S-curve and if you're working across
        different domains, you're almost guaranteed to be in the exponential
        section of at least one of those S-curves. Despite knowing that in the
        abstract, it's hard to feel detached from your current work
        <em>right now</em>. Even if I hope to look back and pick apart all the
        ways in which my work was crap, I would be absolutely devastated to have
        someone else say that to me at this moment. Our egos cannot take the
        criticism in the same way until we've achieved some distance from work
        and become more confident in who we are.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, thinking about this in the abstract helps feel at least a
        little bit better about critical feedback for my current work. And if
        that stops being true then hopefully you're reading the musings of your
        future boss.

      <h1><a href="/posts/how-not-to-exercise.html">How not to exercise</a></h1>
      <h4>Published May. 31, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        We are often reminded these days to treat ourselves. Books and studies
        around habit forming will recommend positive reinforcement of good
        habits by rewarding yourself for each positive behavior. My newest bad
        habit shows that taking this mantra <em>too</em> seriously is like
        taking 2 steps forward and <em>n</em> steps back, where
        <em>n</em> represents a number which I don't want to think about. The
        initial objective was to explore the new cities I'd moved to and get
        myself out for some longer walks or bike rides. Fresh air and exercise,
        what could go wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
        To incentivize myself I set some destination point for some new treat,
        usually a donut or ice cream shop at least half an hour away, to act as
        a reward for accomplishing this goal. This worked to great effect and
        had me exploring all around nearby neighborhoods all for the cost of
        some spent calories. Unfortunately, it turns out that my brain's sugar
        response was a bit <em>too</em> powerful for this to be sustainable. I
        soon found my Pavlovian response kicking in every time I would leave the
        house for anything. Out for a grocery run? Hmm isn't there a donut shop
        a bit further down the road? Chatting with a friend on a walk? Oh, might
        as well grab some fro-yo.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an attempt to justify my behavior, I propose a thought experiment:
        Who is likely to live a "healthier" life? The man doing regular, intense
        exercise and crushing two scoops of ice cream and a decadent donut every
        day? Or the man living a relaxed life, never exceeding 60 bpm heart
        rate, with not a gram of sugar in his body? Let my tombstone show that I
        undertook these endeavors with all the gravitas associated with such a
        scientific endeavor, for who could argue that there were any other
        options left to take?
      </p>

        How easy it is to forget the pains that come along with trying to DIY
        everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just when I thought I'd started to wrap my head around some of the finer
        points of configuring Vim just the way I like it, I was hit with a
        painful roadblock. While trying to write a Python script, I noticed that
        despite the syntax highlighting working as expected, nothing I do could
        get the indentation right. Unfortunately indentation is far from
        superficial in Python meaning I would have to install some new plugin to
        autoformat things and fix whatever was broken &mdash; not exactly how I
        wanted to spend my Sunday.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flash forward two hours later and it turns out all of this fuss was due
        to a buggy <code>if</code> statement in my .vimrc, bleh. Did I learn
        some new things? Yes, I suppose I now have a better appreciation for how
        Vim handles filetypes and indentation. But the real lesson here was one
        high school teachers tried to hammer home a long time ago, don't copy
        random (.vimrc) files from the interwebs without knowing what they're
        doing. A reminder for future me that it's better to focus on
        understanding the basics instead of FOMOing about the fancy stuff.

      <h4>Published May. 29, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        We take it for granted that our ability to see colors and hear pitch
        make our lives richer. We would lament the loss of our ability to see
        the color green or our ability to hear a clear C; trees would lose their
        majesty and songs their beat. Yet we willingly deny ourselves the
        opportunity to cry. "Men don't cry" the saying goes and with it goes a
        corresponding richness of experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the majority of my adolescence, I cried only in the most extreme
        situations of stress. In my suburban upbringing, this was fortunately
        tantamount to girl troubles and feelings of loneliness. After my
        freshman year in university, my zone of tears started to expand to the
        occasional movie. If you don't shed a tear at Robin Williams's
        recollection of holding his dying friend on the battlefield and watching
        his wife wither away from cancer in <em>Good Will Hunting</em>, you are
        some kind of monster. While small, this departure from crying from
        personal stress to crying for something beyond me
        <em>felt</em> different, like something new had been unlocked. While I
        would experience these empathic tears more fully on some subsequent MDMA
        trips, I still could not shake the embarrassment that followed every
        episode, that I had transgressed some tenet of manhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        That changed almost overnight after my unexpected
        <a href="/posts/develop-empathy.html" target="_blank"
          >empathy training</a
        >. I found myself brought to tears by the book I was reading at the
        time, <em>Flowers for Algernon</em>. I didn't make anything of it at the
        time, if you didn't cry reading the last few journal entries, you are
        some kind of monster. But then it happened again with another book. And
        another one. And then by a new song I had listened to. And then again...
        Now keep in mind that this was not some sort of mental breakdown where I
        was crying everyday but this certainly felt like a departure from the
        handful of times I had cried in the past <em>decade</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't feel any weaker than before. Emotionally speaking, I felt more
        secure than I ever had in the past. No longer was crying a source of
        embarrassment or shame, but just a natural expression of really
        connecting with something &mdash; I was seeing a new color to which I
        was previously blind. Of course my old purposes were still served, I
        would go on to cry plenty about my upcoming girl troubles. But now I
        would also cry for troubles never faced: wars never experienced, loved
        ones not yet lost, valuable friendships still standing. What a color
        this was.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're reading this and you're skeptical, I hear you. This is
        admittedly somewhat beyond the pale. But I would encourage you to think
        about the things in your life and reflect on their value. Consider that
        your next meal will be the last one you ever eat. Or that time hanging
        out with your friend will be the last time you see him. Or that last
        goodbye you said to a loving parent will truly be the last. Reflect that
        as far fetched as these may seem, one day they will all be true. If it
        is okay to shed tears to mourn their loss tomorrow, then it must be okay
        to shed tears to celebrate their existence today.

      <h1><a href="/posts/why-learn-history.html">Why learn history?</a></h1>
      <h4>Published May. 28, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        Looking back, this question has had many different answers at many
        different times in my life. While most people will state with absolute
        certainty their current reason for learning history, there is often far
        more nuance. And with the constant battles to propagandize school
        curriculums one way or another, it's worth being clear on what the goal
        is.
      </p>
      <p>
        My earliest recollection of learning history is in fifth grade. We
        covered ancient civilizations (i.e. Egypt) before spending the rest of
        the time on the Middle Ages in Europe. The purpose was to get a sense of
        how human beings, just like me, had for many many years lived vastly
        different lives; going so far as to dress up and roleplay different
        characters in a medieval banquet (I was a nobleman of course). This
        broader cultural awareness can be powerful and is often a discount
        version of the benefits of traveling as a child.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that began the long arc of Canadian history. Starting with
        voyageurs and the fight for Canadian independence in grade school,
        taking a weird detour into residential schools in early high school, and
        culminating in Canada's involvement in the World Wars and the
        definitely-pivotal-and-totally-earth-shattering Battle of Vimy Ridge. In
        hindsight, I realize that this whole curriculum was designed to build up
        a national identity in teenagers starting to discover themselves, to
        really instill a sense of Canadian pride with values such as humility
        and courage. History became a tool to impress upon me the values of the
        society I was growing up in; an empowering experience if done right and
        a catalyst for bitter conflict if done wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout this period, my contemporary self never really questioned the
        value of learning history. The reason was clear: learning history, like
        keeping up with current events, was the entry ticket to the
        intelligentsia. It was a way to feel superior and knowledgeable.
        History, news, and politics were the trifecta for qualifying as a
        learned adult. While that reason didn't last, it did at least serve as
        an entry ticket to a seat on our school's Reach for the Top team,
        catapulting me to instant fame and generating unbounded sex appeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        After high school, upon realizing that there were armies of people more
        knowledgeable than me, I was left to fill my panicked insecurity through
        other intellectual flexes. And thus, my relationship with history
        changed again. The little history I would come across was purely for
        entertainment. As true crime has proven over the past couple of decades,
        historical events can capture the human psyche more completely than even
        the best Agatha Christie novel. In such a way did history, in the form
        of The 300 Spartans or the drama of the Middle East, persist in the
        peripheries of college life.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few years later I crossed the final threshold of human awakening:
        paying taxes. History then became a powerful tool to backtest different
        systems of governance and life. A way to try and answer why Canada had
        adopted certain social systems while the US had adopted others. And
        while we should be cautious about trying to extrapolate the benefits of
        shogunates in 21st century California, learning history does help glean
        potential consequences of communism or fascism.
      </p>
      <p>
        I realize now that there is no best reason for why we should learn
        history. I urge you to pause and reflect on why you think it's valuable.
        And what part of that value you want to pass onto children, keeping in
        mind that curriculums are zero-sum. Are we trying to teach different
        perspectives or are we indoctrinating? History repeats itself, but we
        should be careful about what we want to repeat.

      <h4>Published May. 21, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        As my blog posts continue, I realize that having every single post in
        its entirety on on page will not scale. It's difficult to read through
        earlier posts, there are no previous or next links. There are no tags to
        organize for the different topics. Fixing any of these problems poses a
        non-trivial challenge considering my static site generator is composed
        of a single bash script. And yet, in spite of (or perhaps because of)
        that jankiness, I love my site.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is something special about simplicity and understanding. While I
        could have easily solved all those problems with a WordPress site, I
        would have lost all the pain and struggle that came with figuring out
        how to add a simple link to my nav bar. I would have lost the joy that
        comes with cooking your own meal, building your own computer, or even
        changing your own oil. It doesn't matter how simple or mundane the task
        is, it matters that you are closer to mastery in some small domain. With
        every big push in tech to outsource everything, from couriers to deliver
        food to personal assistants to answer emails, we get further from this
        general mastery. Further from the master-of-all-trades Renaissance man
        of old that we idealize.
      </p>
      <p>
        Refuse the conveniences, take a peek under the hood, and focus on the
        <em>bare minimum</em> that you care about, and tackle it from first
        principles. This is how to find flow, this is how to gain mastery.
      </p>
      <p>
        As things scale, I'm sure I'll learn why using two text files for a
        database is not a good idea. Or why hardcoding html snippets in a bash

      <h4>Published May. 19, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        Last night I dreamt I was in a competition to build large scale art
        exhibits. As with all dreams, I have no idea how I got there, I
        certainly am not a top pick for such an exercise. Fortunately for me, my
        team seemed completely unfazed by my ineptitude and methodically built
        up a wondrous room-sized display of wood and metal. Sheets of metal were
        punched out and cut down to resemble ivy and the wood gave a sense of
        all of this simply being a part of nature. As with all dreams, I cannot
        quite put into words the details. What I remember clearly is a sense of
        awe at the whole thing. Somehow these people envisioned and built this
        wondrous structure, a feat beyond me in my wildest dreams!... Oh wait.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wasn't this exactly within my imagination? While writing this, I can
        humbly tell you that I have no idea how I'd begin to replicate the
        endeavor. Yet, wasn't it my own mind that effortlessly created and
        constructed, however impossibly, the whole thing? How bizarre this sense
        of creativity is. And how subconciously it occurs. Our brains
        paradoxically create the impossible while disbelieving its ability to
        create. Are we really of two (or more) minds as some research shows? Or
        is this all part of some cohesive singular experience? My conclusion:
        dreams are weird man.

      <h4>Published May. 17, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        On a podcast some years ago, I came across a simple yet powerful litmus
        test to decide which side of a complicated conflict lines up with my
        personal values. Imagine if one side had complete and total power, what
        are <em>they</em> saying they'd do with that power? If the answer
        appalls you, problem solved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, things are not always so simple. A party may outwardly state
        one objective but secretly have another. But, at least in the case of
        international conflict, you'll be surprised at how often a group's
        publicly stated mission goes completely against your beliefs.

      <h4>Published May. 16, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        On my site's <a href="/books/">reading list</a> I decided for the
        absolutely minimal amount of classification possible to avoid the mess
        of having to rank books or cateogorize adding them in, landing on a
        simple fiction vs nonfiction. I've been satisfied by my choice up until
        a conversation about the book I was to read next, "You're reading the
        Bible? Would that classify as fiction or nonfiction?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Like with any good tough, potentially philosophical question, I
        immediately looked to the Internet for an answer. I read one Quora
        answer and thought I'd be satisfied.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The bible is nonfiction as in 'not fiction'. Fiction refers to a novel
        or collection of short stories."
      </p>
      <p>
        Case closed, or so I thought. Had I stopped there, perhaps it would have
        been. But my eyes went to the next answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It depends on who you ask. Some people pay call it fiction and others
        nonfiction, and others neither at all."
      </p>
      <p>
        Each successive answer confused me more. I was honestly expecting the
        typical Internet two-sided shouting match. But instead, I found a
        dizzying potpourri.
      </p>
      <p>
        More digging and more confusion. It seems like I was not going to find a
        clear answer here. There seemed to be a general consensus that my
        perfect binary taxonomy was not sufficient. So how to solve this problem
        of where to add the Bible while still keeping the minimalist effort I
        desired? Simple. Remove all classification. So whenever I finally get
        through that behemoth of a book, gone will be the old class system, all
        books will unite as one. But while all books will be equal, some books
        may be <em>more</em> equal than others. Stay tuned.

        With every achievement accomplished, your brain rushes with another
        high. An intense, gratifying inward cry of "I'm good enough." And
        then... it's gone. The next moment is upon you and unconsciously you
        have already scanned for the next empty box to check off. The next one
        will be the one that lasts you assure yourself, starring the empty box.
        Or the one after that &mdash; another star. You glance back at the
        tapestry of thousands of checked off boxes behind you and hesitate
        slightly. Within squinting distance you notice dozens of roughly
        pencilled stars, the handiwork of your past self.
      </p>
      <p>
        Years later, your brain quietly hums with contentment. You feel an itch,
        hear someone shouting something obscene, but your brain hums on. You
        have learned how to find peace by looking inward, and relishing the
        beauty of the world around you. You focus for the next twenty minutes on
        the busy soundscape and a thought drifts into your head: there was some
        greatness you had wanted wanted to achieve, perhaps now is the time. You
        are calmly confident in your ability to accomplish it. You let that
        thought sit with you for a few moments until it passes and another
        replaces it: to what end? You have found love, found peace. A warm
        summer breeze passes, and with it so do your thoughts of greatness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ambition and equanimity lie in subtle yet inescapable tension. Most have
        no grip on the latter. Some try and hold onto both. None succeed. Which
        path do you choose?

      <h4>Published May. 13, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        I was recently discussing the place of politics in the workforce with a
        friend and former colleague. In explaining the importance of pushing
        anti-racism initiatives at work, he stated,
        <em
          >"If you're not a part of the solution, then you're a part of the
          problem."</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I understood the sentiment, one heard frequently in the last year. I
        empathized with why he felt banning political activism was such a
        harmful policy and we moved on. But this left me wondering... Is this
        true? Are we morally culpable for the wrongs around us? This should,
        after all, have a great impact on our behavior and self-worth.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we were to grant this as true, this would lead to some truly
        horrifying conclusions about our own lives. Around the world there are
        millions of people dying and suffering from easily preventable diseases.
        Diseases like measles which have been all but forgotten in North America
        still kill hundreds of children. How many of those deaths are on our
        hands? How many of the homeless that we walk by everyday do we take
        responsibility for?
      </p>
      <p>
        The most compelling articulation for a moral imperative I've found is in
        Peter Singer's famous essay
        <a
          href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/videos-books-and-essays/famine-affluence-and-morality-peter-singer/"

      <blockquote id="drowning-child">
        On your way to work, you pass a small pond. On hot days, children
        sometimes play in the pond, which is only about knee-deep. The weather's
        cool today, though, and the hour is early, so you are surprised to see a
        child splashing about in the pond. As you get closer, you see that it is
        a very young child, just a toddler, who is flailing about, unable to
        stay upright or walk out of the pond. You look for the parents or
        babysitter, but there is no one else around. The child is unable to keep
        her head above the water for more than a few seconds at a time. If you
        don't wade in and pull her out, she seems likely to drown. Wading in is
        easy and safe, but you will ruin the new shoes you bought only a few
        days ago, and get your suit wet and muddy. By the time you hand the
        child over to someone responsible for her, and change your clothes,
        you'll be late for work. What should you do?
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Well?... The argument is powerful in the almost rhetorical question
        posed at the end. Singer states that by choosing not to donate or work
        on this problem, we are choosing to walk past the drowning child. Taking
        this line of reasong to its conclusion, every dollar spent in excess of
        a spartan life is a choice to walk past this child. Aware of this and
        true to form, Singer has pledged to donate all of his income above
        something like a $15k salary. And yet, even Singer does not assign
        culpability by omission.
      </p>
      <p>
        The guilt by omission rhetoric is wielded at the breaking of every big
        news story. By flocking around today's solution, the wielders, by their
        own accord, become a part of yesterday's problem. Singer's point is that
        we ought to make a change, <em>not</em> because we're culpable, but
        because <em>we can</em>. Instead of assigning guilt or complicity unto
        others, we should consider how effectively <em>we</em> can make a
        difference. And given our limited resources, especially our
        <a href="/parabola-of-generosity.html" target="_blank">generosity</a>,
        we should strive to make the most of them. Real change, like investing,
        requires long-term compounding. Focusing on the latest cause is as
        likely to help society as investing in the latest meme coin is likely to
        make us rich. Focus on finding what is impactful and what is effective,
        and like Singer put your money where your mouth is.

      <h4>Published May. 12, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        Some things in life are so commonplace and mundane that we never stop to
        question them. Only when you see things done another, perhaps
        contradictory, way you're left wondering why you never questioned it in
        the first place. Like the first time learning that some countries drive
        on the opposite side of the road. Or when you met someone certain they
        don't want children. I recently had this existential crisis with
        workplace benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Apr. 2021, the cofounders of Basecamp faced intense backlash for
        <a
          href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5"
          target="_blank"
          >announcing</a
        >
        changes that included a ban on societal and political discussions on
        company account. While this is worth opining on (see thoughts
        <a href="/posts/office-sans-politics.html" target="_blank">here</a>), it
        was the overshadowed second change that really caught me off guard.
      </p>
      <blockquote id="change-2">
        <strong>2. No more paternalistic benefits.</strong> For years we've
        offered a fitness benefit, a wellness allowance, a farmer's market
        share, and continuing education allowances. They felt good at the time,
        but we've had a change of heart. It's none of our business what you do
        outside of work, and it's not Basecamp's place to encourage certain
        behaviors &mdash; regardless of good intention. By providing funds for
        certain things, we're getting too deep into nudging people's personal,
        individual choices.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This concept of providing taxable non-cash benefits has been around for
        a while but the psychology of it was formalized by Richard Thaler and
        Cass Sunstein, and published in their book <em>Nudge</em>. Along with
        the rationale was coined the term "libertarian paternalism", a term
        meant to evoke images of a loving father raising a free-thinking child
        under his wise and knowing tutelage. But stated directly, the philosophy
        dictates that institutions should exert their will through subtle
        psychologial manipulation, while still leaving us free to overcome them.
        This to me is the Nobel Prize-winning version of passive-aggressiveness.
        Your libertarian paternalistic roommates aren't <em>forcing</em> you to
        do the dishes but they might stop mentioning which one of them did the
        dishes last week if you do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Universally, these paternalistic workplace benefits are
        well-intentioned. Stripe initially had an unlimited vacation policy but,
        like other employers, found that employees were still getting burnt out
        and not taking enough vacation. The solution? Re-implement accruals and
        caps. This was clearly a thought-out move to benefit employees, by using
        loss aversion to overpower cultural and self-imposed stigmas around
        taking "too much" vacation. And recently, this was ramped up through
        additional days that had to be used within the next 3 or 6 months or
        lost forever. These nudges, the employer equivalent of "Limited time
        only!" sales tactics, are based on the assumption that employers know
        what's better for us than we do. The focus could have been to send
        communications to reduce stigma and empower employees, with management
        leading by example. But instead, employers choose the lazier nudging
        approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        The unsettling aspect is that, while well-intentioned, benefits are used
        in ways that are the least likely to be questioned as opposed to what is
        truly best for us. The biggest example is the frequent availability of
        alcohol as a benefit. If employers really wanted the healthiest outcome
        for employees, they could simply state that the company would only be
        expensing non-alcoholic drinks. Or better yet, prevent sending messages
        for non-mission critical employees between 10:00 pm &ndash; 6:00 am to
        encourage sleeping well. While objectively healthier, nudges like these
        would be far too overt to be palatable by employees. The watchful
        paternalistic hand must avoid raising suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Weirdly though, even hyper-analytical people seem to enjoy these
        paternalistic benefits instead of demanding that they be paid out. I
        think this highlights the depth of our mental accounting bias, the
        tendency for us to not view money as fungible. We view a $1000 education
        benefit as a huge improvement over a $0 education benefit but a view a
        $1000 raise as insultingly low on a $100k salary. This presents
        employers an arbitrage opportunity: boosting employee satisfaction by
        reapportioning compensation to smaller benefits instead of increasing
        total compensation. But aside from situations with bulk purchasing
        benefits such as health insurance, I'd always rather have the cash to
        make my own choices. Benefits are not some free lunch but rather chunks
        of your compensation that have been locked up to be released with good
        behavior. The paternal hand will only give us our allowance if we spend
        it "the right way".
      </p>

        This whole system leads to some weird conclusions: Does your employer
        offer a stop-smoking benefit? Smoking employees get paid more. How about
        a gym benefit? Fitter employees get paid more. Retirement account
        matching? Scrupulous employees get paid more. Compensation starts
        getting linked to completely extrinsic behaviors but the ubiquity and
        positive framing of these benefits lead us to never give pause. As Gerd
        Gigerenzer calls out in his paper
        <em>The Bias Bias in Behavioral Economics</em>, a focus on maximizing
        autonomy and education are the long-term solutions to better outcomes.
        If we are able to learn from their mistakes and decide what is best for
        ourselves, then why do we let our employer guide our lifestyle outside
        of work? Next time your employer starts listing off their benefits, ask
        whether you can take them in cash. After all, who knows what's best for
        you?

        <li>
          Not comingling with the other sex. It's the 21st century, you're not a
          bigot/misogynist/sexist. Definitely an anti-value.
        </li>
        <li>
          Being homophobic. Still living in the 21st century, you're not a
          bigot/homophobe. You're maybe not <em>really</em> totally 110%
          comfortable with it but let's not dwell on that. Probably an
          anti-value.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wearing recommended clothing. "Woah, are you backwards or repressed?"
          Maybe an anti-value.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not watching porn or masturbating. Nobody has ever talked about this
          out loud so maybe it's not even technically illegal. Let's say
          decriminalized if it's less than twice a day. You're secretly hopeful
          that incognito mode protects you from employers and omnipotent beings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Understanding the Qu'ran. You've read the whole Qu'ran, maybe even
          more than once. Of course, to keep its integrity, you read it in
          Arabic. Unfortunately, you don't speak a word of Arabic and reading it
          in English never occurred to you.
        </li>
        <li>Reading the Qu'ran. See above.</li>
        <li>
          Praying. Recommended but optional. Kind of like the extra non-graded
          assignments your teachers recommended; yeah you should be doing them
          but nobody else is doing them and you'll probably still pass.
        </li>
        <li>
          Giving zakat. You'll definitely do this when you have the money,
          that's just not yet. And you're pretty sure your dad's still paying
          for your entry on the holy ledger so you're probably fine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not having sex before marriage. What does this even really mean?
          Anything but PIV is fine, right? Maybe you've crossed that line too
          but what does it really matter if you're <em>planning</em> on getting
          married to this person? And even if you're not planning on marrying
          this person, what does it really matter if you're planning on getting
          married to some person at some point?
        </li>
        <li>
          Not drinking or taking drugs. You're not really gonna try to justify
          this one but hey, nobody's perfect. People need to loosen up a little.
          Maybe this is only for special occasions... Which occur two to four
          times a week.
        </li>
        <li>
          Observing Ramadan. Super important time to make up for all your other
          slippages. Double down here and you buy yourself another year of
          mistakes, right? But exceptions are required. An actual quote from the
          past week, "I know it's Ramadan but I'm still definitely down for
          tomorrow night. I have been <em>needing</em> to get fucked up."
        </li>
        <li>
          Not eating pork. The most sacred aspect of faith, never to be
          questioned and never to be broken. This is your hill to die on. Having
          beers with your friends and they're about to order pepperoni pizza? "I
          can't, I'm Muslim."
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Don't take this too seriously in case I got your order wrong. Just some
        funny observations from decades spent growing up around people trying to
        reconcile identity, faith, and life in North America.

      <p>
        I wake up and grab my phone&mdash;it's 7:30 a.m., Friday. I feel a
        little groggy, definitely went to bed a little too late last night in a
        YouTube blackhole about homes I will never be able to afford. Oops. I
        really don't feel like working today but at least the weekend is almost
        here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I quickly check up on my messages: a brief skim through texts,
        Messenger, Instagram, Signal, and WhatsApp. I'm a little disappointed, I
        for some reason expected&mdash;hoped for more. I don't have time to
        respond to what's there but fire off a few quick reactjis to the best
        ones. I'll get to it later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Up next, email inboxes. It's too early for work emails though. Nothing
        but the usual junk, some spammy newsletters, bank updates, and sales
        codes I was expecting. I'll save the news articles for later, not really
        feeling it right now. I really should get around to unsubscribing from
        these one of these days... Select all, delete. Back to inbox zero,
        already starting the day with some progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really should get out of bed but let's just quickly check-in on my
        favorite subreddits. LOL couple good posts. Quick check of the homepage.
        LOL the internet is amazing. Nothing great past page 3 though, the
        upvotes got it right. A quicker tour through Instagram, tossing a single
        heart, I see that there's nothing great.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shit, time to actually get up. Tune into my favorite podcast while I get
        ready for the day and check up those news articles in my inbox. Shit is
        crazy these days, I can't believe this is where we're at. Hop back into
        my audiobook while I start brewing coffee. God, that smells good. I
        didn't realize my head was aching but it's already dying down before the
        coffee is ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pop open my meditation app for a quick session to start the day off.
        Much better. Halfway through the cup and I'm feeling human again. Time
        to hop onto the first Zoom call of the day: "Hey team!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Glad that's over with. Ugh let's check in on the work emails... "53 new
        messages". Great. I'll just check Slack first before really digging
        through this. Agh, a few requests I missed last night. Let me just do
        them right now before I forget. Done. And I'll mark everything else as
        unread so I don't forget to come back to it later (I hope). Time to
        tackle that inbox again. 45 minutes later and done. Back to inbox zero.
        Do I really need to work the rest of the day? This seems like a lot for
        a Friday.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jk, I wish. Now it's time to actually get some stuff done. My morning
        podcast won't do, this is going to require my work playlist on Spotify.
        Plugged back into the headphones <em>aaaaand we're off</em>. I drop back
        into the messaging apps a few times when I have a second to write out my
        responses and see what friends have to say. Respond to a couple more
        pings as well and hop into another call. I cannot seem to focus, TGIF.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally lunch time. Pop open last night's UberEats into the microwave
        while browsing YouTube for something to watch and checking up my
        messages. Gotta find something "educational" of course, it's still work
        hours. New episode of Last Week Tonight? Sweet. Food is ready, and we're
        good to go. Go through a couple more episodes while I'm putting in the
        dishes. Shit, next call is in a few minutes. 2x through the rest of the
        video and <em>just</em> squeeze into the call. Nailed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I quickly check up on my messages again after the call, no responses
        though. Back to the playlist to hammer out the rest of the afternoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        TGIF! Did I say that already? Don't have much planned (thanks #COVID)
        but relieved nontheless. I'll go out for a quick walk and workout.
        Should I tune back in the podcast? Queue up my workout playlist? Or
        maybe call someone? Nah, too tired for a call. Let's go with the
        podcast. I'll hit the playlist when I start the workout.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back to cook up some dinner. Quickly 2x through the recipe video again
        just to make sure I'm not forgetting anything and turn on a couple funny
        videos in the meantime. Food is ready, can't wait to enjoy it. But what
        do I watch with dinner? I know, I'll catch up on that latest Netflix
        series.
      </p>
      <p>
        Work finished. Workout completed. Dinner cooked. Sucks that I can't hang
        out with friends (#COVID) but at least I have some time to finally
        unwind and decompress. What to watch? Don't have the energy for a movie
        or something heavy. I turn to my current comedy pick, satirical and
        topical, just what I need. Hit play, grab my phone, and catch up with
        friends in the meantime.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's getting late, time to start getting ready for bed. Plug back into
        my audiobook while going through the nightly routine. At least not going
        out means I can catch up on sleep. I get into bed but I'm not
        <em>quite</em> asleep yet so I just quickly catch up on messages again.
        Nothing else good on Reddit or Insta. I'll just take a quick peek at
        TikTok before passing out. LOL the internet is amazing. Did I say that
        already? It's 1:00 am!? Fuck. Not again.

      <h4>Published May. 8, 2021</h4>

        In Oct. 2020, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took a
        <a
          href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804"
          target="_blank"
          >divisive stance</a
        >
        on keeping politics out of the workplace. Sparked by employee walkouts
        in reaction to Armstrong's reluctance to publicly comment on the BLM
        movement, this stance was cemented in the wake of heated political
        discussions preceding the Nov. 2020 US Presidential elections. In Apr.
        2021, Basecamp founders
        <a
          href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5"
          target="_blank"
          >Jason Fried</a
        >
        and
        <a
          href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/basecamp-s-new-etiquette-regarding-societal-politics-at-work-b44bef69"
          >DHH</a
        >
        followed suit, stating that there were to be no more societal or
        political discussions in workplace channels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both companies issued the statements alongside generous severance
        packages ranging from three to six months' pay and benefits. In the
        aftermath, Coinbase lost 60 employees, representing 5% of its workforce,
        and Basecamp lost 20 employees, representing a staggering
        <em>35%</em> of its workforce.
      </p>
      <p>
        While long backstories are needed to examine those as case studies
        (along with a sense of base rate attrition from such a severance policy
        alone), this got me interested in the philosophical idea of what role
        politics ought to play at work. If every company had to issue a "Yea or
        nay?" directive tomorrow regarding politics in work platforms, what
        should they do?
      </p>
      <p>
        From the employee side, I get that people want to work somewhere that
        reflects their values. I would certainly be reluctant to take a
        comparable role at a payday loan provider or tobacco producer. For many
        people, this reflection of values extends to working somewhere that
        represents their political views. Identity at work, especially for
        millenials seems to have moved from "What are we creating?" to "What do
        we stand for?". The fusion of these has led to confusing wonders such as
        Ben & Jerry's
        <a href="https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new#" target="_blank"
          >What's New</a

          target="_blank"
          >The Derek Chauvin Murder Trial: What's At Stake</a
        >. Both highly topical and important topics to be sure, but a little
        more than I bargained for with my soft serve and sprinkles.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my experience, I have had positive political experiences at work
        which involved listening to people from specific groups share their
        personal experiences and concerns on a relevant topic. Given the size
        and absolute diversity of the workplace, I gained a perspective wholly
        unavailable to me given my friend group outside of work. However, these
        sessions involve sharing of exclusively mainstream left-wing views which
        are far from unanimous. And I'm confident that these public sharing
        sessions would not be so well-received if they centered on right-wing
        views, which hints at the heart of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        What people really want with politics in the workplace, as evidenced by
        the walkouts in 2020, is a place to share their political views and have
        them affirmed by leadership. Opposing views are loudly decried and end
        up triggering many. Sharing political views on a podium, at work or
        elsewhere, does not permit for safe rebuttal or dissent. Speaking to an
        audience of more than a couple of people quickly triggers the identity
        and posturing part of our brains and pushback is perceived as a threat
        to be neutralized. Somebody must win the public opinion. What was once a
        place to work together on creating a specific value to society quickly
        devolves into another shouting match.
      </p>
      <p>
        What really changes hearts and minds are individualized, intimate
        conversations. People often say that you ought not to talk about
        religion or politics at work but I disagree. In a one-on-one setting,
        especially at work, it's much easier to know that we're on the same
        team. We can argue about the whole world, move on positions without
        losing face, and grab a drink afterwards, closer than we were before.
        Things get hairy when you move to talking about politics at work
        <em>at scale</em>, as is the case in public work channels. So to all the
        CEOs mulling over tomorrow's big "Yea or nay?", vote "Nay". Leave the
        office as a place to drive specific value and unify anyone interested in
        that mission; let the politics <em>follow</em> from that unity and not
        divide it.

A good text file is like good peanut butter,

      <p>
        In March 2019, I had one of the most eye-opening (pun intended)
        experiences of my life.
      </p>
      <p>"For the next three minutes, gaze into your partner's eyes."</p>
      <p>
        Partner, in this case, referred to a stranger who'd I'd spoken to for
        less than five minutes. Wasn't this supposed to be a course on
        rationality? The previous weeks covered topics such as mental models and
        Bayesian thinking so what was with this weird stuff? Mostly to avoid the
        greater embarrassment of sitting out, I played along.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first few seconds were easy, our eyes met with a mutual
        acknowledgement of the comedy of the situation. The rest of the first
        minute ended up being an unspoken game of "Who will laugh first?" The
        discomfort of just gazing directly into a stranger's eyes for some
        reason made everyone in the room want to giggle, presumably in the hope
        that laughter would dissolve the awkwardness. It did not...
      </p>
      <p>
        We get through the initial giggles and enter minute two. I stifled my
        laughter and intensified my gaze, doubling down on my resolve to make it
        through this without feeling totally emasculated. Somewhere within that
        second minute, I found myself smiling again, but this time not out of
        embarrassment. I noticed we're both smiling and that now there was a
        sense of warmth and comfort associated with it. My intensity turned to
        curiosity, "Who is this other human looking at me? How is she feeling?
        How did she come to be staring into my eyes today?" And of course, "Is
        she thinking what I'm thinking?"
      </p>
      <p>
        The final minute ended far too quickly. By that time we were pointing
        out interesting features in each other's eyes and reflecting on how
        weird it is to be afraid of this. We're in the middle of sharing our
        life stories interrupted&mdash;"Time's up."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now for the next two minutes discuss how you felt but start each
        sentence with 'When you say that, I feel...' And state an actual
        feeling: confusion, excitement, embarrassment. None of this 'I feel
        <em>like</em>...' that we usually use, instead of actually sharing how
        we feel. Share your acutal feelings. We are always mentally preparing
        what we want to say next while the other person is talking, what they
        say is usually secondary. See how that changes now."
      </p>
      <p>
        What followed was what I can only describe as a conversation with a
        friend of many years. Of the sort that you only have
        <em>after</em> you've spent hours catching up on the mundane. There was
        no shame in talking about my embarrassment or her intimidation, just
        open sharing of raw emotions. For the rest of that day, I found myself
        effortlessly engaged and attentive to whatever this stranger had to say.
        My posture had changed from its usual skepticism to an open curiosity.
        And incredibly, that instant reflex to start preparing what I wanted to
        say next had disappeared, I wanted to make sure I caught her every word
        first. In the span of five minutes, we'd accomplished what would
        normally take a couple hours of EDM music and a healthy dose of MDMA.
      </p>
      <p>
        Up to that point in my life, my approach to persuading others involved
        presenting facts, setting up logical arguments, and calling out biases
        or fallacies. This was in line with my understanding of rationality:
        whoever presented the most undeniable evidence was right. I was, of
        course, always right so cue my confusion at my general inability to
        persuade almost anyone. I would occassionally convince a close friend of
        something or another, often begrudgingly, so I chalked up the rest of my
        failed attempts to the irrationality of the other party; they just
        weren't thinking about things the right way.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what I learned that day in the rationality course was that being
        truly rational meant meeting other people where they were at. Once you
        take even a little bit of time to build empathy, making yourself
        understood becomes easy. My decision to continue my debate-style
        approach despite its horrendous success demonstrated
        <em>my</em> irrationality first and foremost. Being rational involved
        understanding others' perspectives <em>in their own words</em> before
        attempting to change them. In my childish world view, I had conflated
        correctness with rationality, and ended up often missing the mark on
        both.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that day, I immediately dove in to Marshall Rosenberg's work on
        <em>Nonviolent Communication</em>, the source of inspiration for the
        exercises. While going through the motions felt painfully awkward and
        forced, the results were truly remarkable. Without even having the
        conversations, I felt as if I understood people better, revitalizing my
        posture towards relationships I'd soured for many years. I tried eagerly
        to recommend it to anyone within earshot but pitching a YouTube
        <a href="https://vid.puffyan.us/watch?v=l7TONauJGfc" target="_blank"
          >video</a
        >
        of an old man wearing hand puppets is admittedly not an easy sell.
        Reassuringly however, after reading
        <em>Never Split the Difference</em> and
        <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em>, I realized that all
        these books were saying the same thing, tailored to different audiences.
        A hostage negotiator, a self-help guru, and an international peacemaker
        all had the same basic truth: that people need to be understood to
        change, and the only way to get there is to listen without trying to be
        heard. Develop empathy as a rational tool. To be truly rational is to
        choose the most effective method of persuasion.

      <h1><a href="/posts/are-you-rich.html">Are you rich?</a></h1>
      <h4>Published May. 2, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        However many times this question has come up, the universal answer I
        hear is "No". Perhaps this is a reflection of my circle or my
        environment? Maybe I'm surrounded by people working in low-wage service
        jobs or perhaps I'm in a country with a relatively low standard of
        living? Alas no, this is the response from yuppies in their mid-20s
        mostly earning more than $100k/year in two of the richest countries in
        the world. Ironically, many of these people today would exceed the
        definition of rich <em>they themselves</em> had given only a couple
        years prior. Today, that old definition seems irrelevant and any new
        definition is left vague.
      </p>
      <p>
        We often snidely refer to rich people as the 1% and yet in my experience
        the
        <a
          href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/dv-vd/inc-rev/index-eng.cfm"
          target="_blank"
          ><em>actual</em></a
        >
        1% and 2% sheepishly deny such classification, instead choosing to self
        identify as "middle class". People are notoriously comparative
        creatures, especially when it comes to money, but it seems that 98th
        percentile income in a 90th percentile
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita"
          target="_blank"
          >country</a
        >
        is still insufficient to self-identify as rich. While this is a genuine
        puzzle to me, I have a few rough thoughts as to why this might be the
        case:
      </p>
      <ul id="rich-excuses">
        <li>
          Having worries or fears about money and thinking that to be
          incompatible with being rich.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not meeting up to previous generations' benchmarks of wealth.
          Foremost, buying a detached home in the city.
        </li>
        <li>
          Comparing against only those richer than you when defining who is
          rich. Given how wealth is Pareto distributed, it's easy to find
          someone making 10x or 100x more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Guilt about one's own
          <a href="/posts/parabola-of-generosity.html" target="_blank"
            >lack of generosity</a
          >
          relative to what one expects of the rich.
        </li>
        <li>
          Having a feeling that there's not much left over at the end of the
          month.
        </li>
        <li>
          General social taboo to identify as rich. I still hear "no" in
          intimate one-on-one conversations so I don't think this is it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I don't purport to know why most people feel this way, perhaps they
        don't know themselves. But what I do know is that by any reasonable
        measure, they are rich, at least in a financial sense. If you answered
        "no" to this question, I would ask you to consider why and whether that
        is really true, and what being "rich" really looks like?
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up, I remember at some point asking my dad if we were rich; it
        seemed like everyone at school lived more luxuriously than us and my mom
        would often rebuke my asks with a sharp, "We don't have enough money."
        But I was confused because we had recently moved to a big new house, a
        big improvement over the old roach-infested apartment, and gotten a
        shiny new minivan[0], a godsend at the time for my rapidly growing
        frame. My dad gave me a nonresponse citing that it's not important, much
        to my frustration. I had wanted to feel superior to the other kids.
        Everyone else looked happier than me, and I had desperately wanted
        affirmation that there would be a payoff for this repressive upbringing
        and angst&mdash;that I'd have the last laugh in the end because this is
        how you got rich. What my dad got right was that I was asking for the
        wrong reasons. But what he failed to impress upon me were the right
        reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason to ask this question to ourselves is not to gain a sense of
        superiority over others or breed guilt within ourselves, but to bound
        the empty pursuit of money and seek real happiness. It is far easier to
        want more than it is to decide what is enough. And until we truly
        believe we have enough, we can never find peace.

        <a href="/posts/populism-and-wallstreetbets.html"
          >Populism and wallstreetbets</a
        >
      </h1>
      <h4>Published May. 1, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        In late January, I found myself unable to sleep. I felt anxious; a
        little scared even. But most of all... I felt excited. What would
        another day bring to the epic saga of r/wallstreetbets vs "Wall Street"?
        Would GME continue its meteoric rise to $1000? Would paper hands prevail
        and bring everything tumbling down? When would Elon or Ryan Cohen
        weigh-in on whether the squeeze was squoze? It was impossible to say and
        yet the possibilities continued to spiral through my mind. Every guy
        even remotely aware of what was going on quietly had the same thought
        pass through his mind: what it would be like if I became an overnight
        millionaire?
      </p>
      <p>
        How much skin did I have in this game you might ask? How deep was I in
        $GME such that I was losing sleep over a meme?
      </p>
      <p><em>Absolutely nothing.</em> Zip. Nada.</p>
      <p>
        And yet, this David vs Goliath narrative was powerful enough to draw me
        in. The mass media headlines and <em>8 million</em> member growth of
        r/wallstreetbets in February told me that I was not alone. While this
        type of story goes by many names, the prevailing word at the time of
        writing is populism. And though the "p" word has ugly connotations these
        days and associations with far-right extremist groups, the reality is
        that we all find ourselves caught up in the struggles of the everyman in
        some way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most worrying part for me was how emotionally invested I found
        myself <em>despite</em> my complete lack of skin in the game. What does
        that say about my susceptibility to other populist movements? Did I
        really care about Robinhood investors triumphing over Wall Street or was
        I just caught up in the excitement of watching conflict unfold and
        fortunes shift?
      </p>
      <p>
        Eric Hoffer in <em>The True Believer</em> calls out that mass movements
        are much less about the cause itself and much more about how the
        narrative unfolds and the personality traits of would-be movers. This
        theory goes against our sense of being highly conscientious moral agents
        but fits the evidence of getting caught up in GME or
        <a href="/posts/sports-are-dumb.html" target="_blank"
          >identification with sports teams</a
        >. Following the theory leads to the unsavory conclusion that there's
        not a whole lot separating Redditors trying to cancel Vlad from
        Robinhood and SJWs trying to cancel J. K. Rowling. Or, put more
        extremely, not a lot separating violent rioters in Portland from
        insurrectionists in the Capitol Building.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite Hoffer's book being published in 1951 when the consequences of
        nationalism, fascism, and communism all loomed large, the social
        psychology outlined is just as relevant 70 years later. The rise of
        populism is real and not going anywhere. And though hindsight makes it
        easy to classify which movements were right, it is not so easy to
        predict whether we will be the righteous.
      </p>
      <p>
        My suggestions on how to tackle this? Short-term: cut out news and
        social media. The sensationalism and outrage is powerfully designed to
        draw us into the movement of the day. Long-term: be explicit about your
        values, write them down and revisit them every year. Having a strong
        sense of values means that any new thing that wants to capture us must
        first pass through the gauntlet of values.

        <a href="/posts/essential-reading-list.html">Essential reading list</a>
      </h1>
      <h4>Published Apr. 28, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        What are the "essential" things we should learn as students? Nowadays, I
        often hear "coding is the language of the future" or "everyone should
        learn how to program" but like most maxims, this is a gross
        simplification. Yes, everyone who spends 8+ hours a day on a computer
        should learn something about how to use it more effectively, but
        everyone should not be a programmer. However, I firmly believe that
        there are a few foundational skills outside of the current curriculum
        that literally everyone should learn, especially before college when the
        training wheels are kicked off. Curriculums are zero-sum so for
        everything added, something must go; I would rank the following
        topics/courses at least above grade school history, geography, and maybe
        even a second language.
      </p>
      <h2>How to learn</h2>
      <p>
        Encapsulated by Barbara Oakley's <em>Learning How to Learn</em>. This is
        something that sounds so obvious that everyone assumes they know it
        already&mdash;they don't. The critical practical takeaway is knowledge
        of how learning actually happens and how to take advantage of your own
        psychology. Learning this breaks down the idea that there are subjects
        you are good at and bad at, and replaces it with a set of tools to gain
        mastery in any area.
      </p>
      <h2>Managing your time</h2>
      <p>
        Encapsulated by David Allen's <em>Getting Things Done</em>. Given how
        little attention is paid to time management outside of the corporate
        world, every young adult unfortunately learns this through the "sink or
        swim" approach when transitioning from high school to college and
        <em>again</em> from college to beyond. The big thing here is giving
        students the idea that you can break down big looming projects, in life
        and school, into simple actions they can take immediately. Whether they
        stick to the exact process in the book is inconsequential, what matters
        is instilling the belief that even for the most daunting and ambiguous
        of tasks, there is always a simple next step to take. Otherwise,
        ambiguity can only be tackled when
        <a
          href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html"
          >the Panic Monster</a
        >
        rears its head.
      </p>
      <h2>Reading efficiently and effectively</h2>
      <p>
        Encapsulated by Mortimer J. Adler's <em>How to Read a Book</em>. Forget
        everything you've learned in school about how to read and start over the
        right way; these 400 pages sum up what 12 years of formal education
        could not. If you aren't reading the Table of Contents, you're doing it
        wrong. Students should be able to learn how to <em>quickly</em> get the
        gist of a book and go deeper in the rare instances it's needed. It's
        crazy that we are never taught how to understand the big picture,
        instead spending hours poring over single passages or specific words.
        Once the required reading list goes from two books a semester to 6
        papers and 3 books <em>per class</em>, I'd rather know how to find the
        main message of a book in a few minutes than how to surmise what the
        color green <em>really</em> meant in <em>The Great Gatsby</em>.

      <h1><a href="/posts/how-to-grok-sql.html">How to grok SQL</a></h1>
      <h4>Published Apr. 27, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        The rigidity of SQL is both a blessing and a curse. Once you "get it",
        you really get it, there are almost no surprises. But its inflexible
        syntax and difficulty to test also means that it can take some time to
        grok and lead to lots of silent errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confusingly, SQL is not executed top to bottom, the manner in which a
        human would read it. Reasoning about and reading SQL in the actual
        execution order, as outlined below, provides much greater clarity. One
        general tip is to use CTEs (Common Table Expressions AKA
        <code>WITH</code> statements) liberally to keep things organized.
      </p>
      <h2><code>FROM</code></h2>
      <p>
        The most important part of any query and the source of most mistakes.
        Reasoning about this involves visualizing, mentally or on paper, the
        <em>full</em> expansion of each join. Make sure you can state exactly
        what the the primary keys are on each table before joining. Write out
        some rows you expect to be dropped with inner joins, some rows you
        expect to be empty with outer joins, and some rows you expect to be
        duplicated/expanded if you're not joining two tables at the exact same
        level of aggregation. Joining at the wrong level of aggregation is
        really easy and won't return any errors, quietly returning a completely
        incorrect number.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of this step you should have a sense of some giant megatable
        you're creating and be satisfied with what each row in the megatable
        represents. This is likely different than what your left-most table
        started with. Most of the columns in your megatable will never be used
        and the columns you joined on will likely be duplicated&mdash;this is
        okay.
      </p>
      <h2><code>WHERE</code></h2>
      <p>
        Once you have your megatable, decide which rows you don't need. This
        part is relatively well understood. The most common mistake seen stems
        from trying to filter on fields in joined tables when nothing was
        actually joined. Again, having a clear visualization of the megatable
        will help avoid this. Also be explicit about how you handle nulls: if A
        is null and B is 1, A != B may not do what you expect...
      </p>
      <h2><code>GROUP BY</code></h2>
      <p>
        You should know what level of aggregation you need for your
        output&mdash;<em>only group by those fields</em>! This is the second
        most common source of confusion. If you find yourself starting to group
        by numeric fields, stop! If you find yourself grouping by fields that
        are 1:1 or 1:many with your main field, stop! Really common mistakes
        would be grouping by city, state, and country or grouping by person_id,
        person_name, and title. In both of these situations, what you're really
        trying to do is just group by city or person_id first (within a CTE) and
        <em>then</em> join in the additional fields; the additional grouping
        fields are completely redundant! Adding all sorts of unnecessary
        groupings makes the query perform worse and adds confusion.
      </p>
      <h2><code>HAVING</code></h2>
      <p>
        Did you know that this even exists? <code>WHERE</code> but applied at
        the level of <code>GROUP BY</code>. Only want to find duplicates? Only
        care about groups above a certain threshold? This is where you encode
        it.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <code>SELECT</code>
      </h2>
      <p>
        While this seems like the meat and potatoes when first learning, this is
        really near the end of the process and should be straightforward after
        thinking through everything else. Be frugal with what fields you're
        pulling; a <code>SELECT *</code> might be quick to write but could slow
        you down 10x in run time. Window functions can get tricky and are
        outside of the scope of this post.
      </p>
      <h2><code>ORDER BY</code></h2>
      <p>
        You're almost there! Given how late this is in the execution, you can
        order by all the fancy new fields you defined in the last step (aside
        from window functions, womp womp).
      </p>
      <h2><code>LIMIT</code></h2>
      <p>
        You made it! Try to be frugal here as well since you probably just want
        to make sure things are working. Forgetting this can lead to some long
        wait times as your front-end tries to download 1 GB files when a few KB
        would have sufficed.

      <p><em>Choose less, decide more. The simplicity is well worth it.</em></p>
      <p>
        While a rationalist economist may disagree, there is a profound
        difference between choosing and deciding. Choosing is the slow process
        of weighing options against each other, creating some sort of mental
        ranking, and then reflecting on how optimal your process was
        after-the-fact. Deciding is making up your mind either ahead of time or
        within a few moments and then wholly welcoming the consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are generally taught the value of carefully choosing things. Most
        engineering and business majors can relate to the experience of taking
        entire courses related to this; Pugh matrices, Porter's Five Forces,
        SWOT analyses and other junk are pedalled to students as
        industry-standard decision making tools. Yet I can count on one hand the
        number of times I've seen any of these show up in the real world, and
        can count with no hands the number of times they were useful. There is a
        place for being choosy: when making big life decisions around where to
        live, who to be with, what our values are&mdash;but this choosy mode is
        switched on far too often and the cost paid unwittingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we focus our efforts on making sure we make the best possible
        choice for what to buy or where to eat, we rarely consider the cognitive
        load borne for these choices. We commonly spend 30 minutes deciding
        whether to eat out, an hour deciding where to go, and 15 minutes
        deciding what to order. When viewed through a maximalist lens of "did I
        choose the best thing?", it's easy to rationalize that our final choice
        from the best reviewed restaurant (cross-referenced on Google Reviews,
        Yelp, and Reddit of course) really was an improvement over the
        alternative. But the question we should really be asking ourselves is
        what is the <em>least amount of time</em> I can spend to get an outcome
        I'm satisfied with. As poker pro Annie Duke points out in
        <a
          href="https://www.annieduke.com/site/uploads/howToDecide_excerpt.pdf"
          target="_blank"
          ><em>How to Decide</em></a
        >, "The time you take to decide is time that you could be spending doing
        other things, like actually talking to the person sitting with you in
        the restaurant."
      </p>
      <p>
        The best part is that making decisions let's us have some fun while
        getting us that time back. Spending too much money on eating out? Decide
        to never order something over $11 off the menu. Spending hours agonizing
        over that next $100 purchase? Decide to make up your mind after the
        first review you read. Not sure where to eat? Decide on the first place
        on Maps over 4.5 stars that you haven't been to. Not only will you find
        this liberating, you'll also have a great conversation starter next time
        your friends end up in a battle of "I don't know, what do you wanna do?"
        Choose less, decide more. The simplicity is well worth it.

      <h4>Published Apr. 24, 2021</h4>
      <blockquote id="taxi-tips">
        I remember in my early trading days, at age twenty-five or so, when
        money started to become easy. I would take taxis, and if the driver
        spoke skeletal English and looked particularly depressed, I'd give him a
        $100 bill as a tip, just to give him a little jolt and get a kick out of
        his surprise. I'd watch him unfold the bill and look at it with some
        degree of consternation ($1 million would certainly have been better but
        it was not within my means). It was also a simple hedonic experiment: it
        felt elevating to make someone's day with the trifle of $100. I
        eventually stopped; we all become stingy and calculating when our wealth
        grows and we start taking money seriously.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This quote from Nassim Taleb's <em>The Black Swan</em> caught me off
        guard upon first reading and has lingered me with me since. The story
        itself is hardly memorable, something I'd expect to find in the memoirs
        of any self-absorbed Wall Street type. What really got me was the last
        line: that there is some unflattering and unintuitive stopping point for
        our generosity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading this book at age twenty-five or so, when money started to become
        easy, this was an uncomfortable pill to swallow. After a lifetime of
        parsimony, which my close friends would be too eager to confirm, I was
        very compelled by the arguments of Effective Altruism. I had paid off my
        loans, gotten a healthy raise, and realized how little you need to live
        comfortably with no dependents. The trifle of $100, while providing
        almost no marginal utility to me, could provide a significant reduction
        in the likelihood of someone contracting malaria or prevent iodine
        deficiency in hundreds of others. Tipping taxi drivers generously became
        easy, especially since most of those tips were reimbursable.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then, subconsciously and slowly, it became difficult. After another
        healthy raise and promotion, I oddly found myself second guessing my
        prior commitments. The argument for generosity was just as compelling as
        before but it <em>felt</em> a lot harder to give away money. Another
        year passes and I experience a massive increase in income; enough to
        start to question the purpose of money and its role in life. While this
        is the point where most people (naively) think they would suddenly
        become generous benefactors, I find myself growing
        <em>even stingier</em>! What kind of moral deficiency was I afflicted
        with!?
      </p>
      <p>
        I coin this relationship the <em>Parabola of Generosity</em>. I'll save
        you the bandwidth of an image with a few words. Imagine a concave
        quadratic surface with the y-axis representing generosity and x-axis
        representing wealth. Our generosity starts off very low or negative,
        constrained by our complete lack of wealth, increases up to a point in
        as we become self-aware of our relative wealth, and then decreases
        sharply thereafter. The coefficients are dependent on the individual but
        I believe that this general shape is universal (viewed locally).
      </p>
      <p>
        It was around the time of finding myself past peak generosity that I
        came across this passage from Taleb. I felt seen and understood, as if
        I'd been let in on some blas&eacute; rite of passage of the wealthy.
        Unfortunately though, I did not feel vindicated; having someone else
        articulate what I was feeling did not give me the sense of righteousness
        I would have liked.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the Parabola provides an accurate description of experience, it
        does not make a claim about <em>why</em> an inflection point exists. I
        have yet to find a more satisfactory answer than what Taleb has
        outlined: that we start taking money seriously. Wealth goes from a
        feeling of abundance to a feeling of burden. I have a sense (maybe a
        hope) that this quadratic relationship only appears so in a local sense
        and upon zooming out, the relationship becomes cubic. That we reach some
        inflection point of "fuck you" money, after which generosity begins
        increasing again. This seems to hold true for the ultra-wealthy spanning
        from the most villainized Gilded Age industrialists to Bill Gates.
        According to Wikipedia, cubic parabolas are a thing so the theory still
        stands.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for where I'm at now, I am glad to report that I have not stopped
        giving. Meditation and the occasional revisiting of works by Peter
        Singer and Will MacAskill help the reasoned part of my brain set up
        automated systems to bypass System 1. To someone experiencing something
        similar, I'd advise taking a step back to evaluate how your values have
        changed over time. If the change in wealth has outpaced the change in
        values, it's worth overcoming that stinginess&mdash;before we find
        ourselves writing our own self-absorbed Wall Street type memoirs.

        Over the last few years, fueled in part by curiosity and in part by the
        search for the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe,
        and Everything, I have tried implementing a variety of lifestyle
        changes. Most of these ideas have come from separate sources and some
        have stuck more than others (I swear I'll start working out everyday
        tomorrow). But taking a step back on some of the more impactful ones
        paints an eerily familiar picture:

        The clear religious bent of this list would outdo many Muslims I know.
        Yet my belief in a traditional God is no stronger than it was before. In
        fact I'd wager that the intense angst and atheist identity formed in my
        teenage years probably made me more resistant to these ideas than most.
        But here we are. Like the final zoom out on
        <a href="https://vid.puffyan.us/watch?v=IceiU-Wmnog" target="_blank"
          >Art Attack</a
        >, it is surprising how a series of small unrelated steps looks from a
        big picture lens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does this mean the seemingly arbitrary rules handed down by religions
        are really some emergent properties that arise from one's search for
        truth and contentment? If so, does that justify the use of more
        persuasive tools such as fear and shame to keep others on the path?
      </p>
      <p>
        While I leave you to ponder the former, I draw a hard line against the
        latter. It is easy, in hindsight, to preach about virtues, but applying
        pressure wantonly does more harm than good. For me, each of these habits
        came from the right conversation at the right time. And the only real
        teacher was lived experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        More insidiously, packaging virtues with negative emotions can backfire
        in a spectacular way. Discovered individually and independently, virtues
        serve as a rock solid foundation for identity; but handed down from God,
        the slightest tremor can cause the house of cards to topple into crisis.
        Inoculation means bottom-up learning. And bottom-up learning means
        making your own mistakes.

        In a couple of recent discussions with friends around books to read and
        suggestions, I drew some ire around my stance on recommendations and
        book clubs&mdash;I am not open to contemporary or topical books. This
        draws criticism without fail and yet my conviction on this has only
        strengthened.

        One compelling argument is summarized well in a Farnam Street

        If we&#39;re reading what everyone else is reading it&#39;s harder to

        There is definitely an element of truth to this but, as my friend
        pointed out, the Murakami quote around the other boys being crap is
        elitist at best. While this vague call to a sense of independence is
        appealing, there is a much better reason to focus on classics.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Adler points out in <em>How to Read a Book</em>, the reason to read
        classics is not to feel &quot;cultured&quot;&mdash;it's to understand
        the rich literary tradition behind everything we know. One cannot really
        understand the significance of <em>Reading Lolita in Tehran</em> without
        first reading <em>Lolita</em>. Or truly walk with Dante through Hell
        without knowing of Virgil. And this lack of understanding is often much
        worse in nonfiction. People nowadays praise Piketty's
        <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> with no knowledge of Marx's
        <em>Capital</em>, which Piketty is transparently trying to build upon.
        And of the few socialists who have actually read Marx, almost none have
        read Adam Smith, whose theories Marx was rebutting. To read only
        contemporary books is to spend your life skating on the tips of
        icebergs, blind to the centuries of thought that have led us to where we
        are today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accepting this truth is one thing, but acting on it is another. This
        path can seem extremely daunting; once you start looking for predecessor
        after predecessor, you realize it's turtles all the way down. And that
        realization can be demotivating enough to justify abandoning the pursuit
        altogether. Fortunately, there are

        out there that help stop the infinite regress. While it would take many
        lifetimes to traverse the entire iceberg of human knowledge, you'll be
        surprised to see how far along you'll get simply by reading
        <em>The Odyssey</em> or <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em>.
      </p>
      <p>As the ancient Chinese proverb goes:</p>
      <blockquote id="journey-of-a-thousand-steps">
        A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

        So dear reader, try taking that first step. Once you cross the chasm
        from Heather's Picks to Homer's Picks, you'll never look back.

        I recently finished reading
        <em>"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman"</em> and found his life to be
        often profound, sometimes cringe, and consistently wonderful. Here is my
        ranking of some of his advice.
      </p>
      <h2>Words to live by</h2>
      <p>
        Above all else, always focus on <em>true</em> understanding. The kind
        which you get from experiencing, teaching others, and extrapolating
        beyond the homework. This idea was best summed up by an analogy in which
        he blasts the Brazilian physics program for its emphasis on volume and
        rote. Unfortunately, the style of education on blast has become the
        norm.
      </p>
      <blockquote id="greek-scholar">
        <p>
          Then I gave the analogy of a Greek scholar who loves the Greek
          language, who knows that in his own country there aren't many children
          studying Greek. But he comes to another country, where he is delighted
          to find everybody studying Greek&mdash;even the smaller kids in
          elementary schools. He goes to the examination of a student who is
          coming to get his degree in Greek, and asks him, &quot;What were
          Socrates' ideas on the relationship between Truth and
          Beauty?&quot;&mdash;and the student can't answer. Then he asks the
          student, &quot;What did Socrates say to Plato in the Third
          Symposium?&quot; the student lights up and goes,
          &quot;<em>Brrrrrrrrr-up</em>&quot;&mdash;he tells you everything, word
          for word, that Socrates said, in beautiful Greek.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what Socrates was talking about in the Third Symposium was the
          relationship between Truth and Beauty!
        </p>
        <p>
          What this Greek scholar discovers is, the students in another country
          learn Greek by first learning to pronounce the letters, then the
          words, and then sentences and paragraphs. They can recite, word for
          word, what Socrates said, without realizing that those Greek words
          actually
          <em>mean</em> something. To the student they are all artificial
          sounds. Nobody has ever translated them into words the student can
          understand.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Try and understand the phenomena itself instead of just the word.</p>
      <blockquote id="just-a-word">
        <p>
          The answer was, for the wind-up toy, &quot;Energy makes it go.&quot;
          And for the boy on the bicycle, &quot;Energy makes it go.&quot; For
          everything, &quot;<em>Energy</em> makes it go.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that doesn't <em>mean</em> anything... The child doesn't learn
          anything; it's just a <em>word</em>!
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Make sure you have a real example to test your understanding.</p>
      <blockquote id="physical-example">
        He thinks I'm following the steps mathematically, but that's not what
        I'm doing. I have the specific, physical example of what he's trying to
        analyze, and I know from instinct and experience the properties of the
        thing.
      </blockquote>
      <p>It is foolish to seek the wisdom of the crowd.</p>
      <blockquote id="emperor-of-china">
        This question of trying to figure out whether a book is good or bad by
        looking at it carefully or by taking the reports of a lot of people who
        looked at it carelessly is like this famous old problem: Nobody was
        permitted to see the Emperor of China, and the question was, What is the
        length of the Emperor of China's nose? To find out, you go all over the
        country asking people what they think the length of the Emperor of
        China's nose is, and you
        <em>average</em> it. And that would be very "accurate" because you
        averaged so many people. But it's no way to find anything out; when you
        have a very wide range of pople who contribute without looking carefully
        at it, you don't improve your knowledge of the situation by averaging.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Reflect on the value of what it is you're achieving. It's easy to get
        caught up in the joy of achievement.
      </p>
      <blockquote id="bob-wilson">
        <p>
          After the [atomic bomb test] went off, there was tremendous excitement
          at Los Alamos. Everybody had parties, we all ran around. I sat on the
          end of a jeep and beat drums and so on. But one man, I remember, Bob
          Wilson, was just sitting there moping.
        </p>
        <p>I said, &quot;What are you moping about?&quot;</p>
        <p>He said, &quot;It's a terrible thing that we made.&quot;</p>
        <p>I said, &quot;But you started it. You got us into it.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          You see, what happened to me&mdash;what happened to the rest of
          us&mdash;is we <em>started</em> for a good reason, then you're working
          very hard to accomplish something and it's a pleasure, it's
          excitement. And you stop thinking, you know; you just <em>stop</em>.
          Bob Wilson was the only one who was still thinking about it, in that
          moment.

      <h1><a href="/posts/sports-are-dumb.html">Sports are dumb</a></h1>
      <h4>Published Apr. 14, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        I'd imagine most people reading the title are either relieved to finally
        hear what they haven't been allowed to say their whole lives or are
        already coming up with answers for why I'm wrong. I'm not talking about
        lowercase sports, the games we play for fun, fitness, and competition. I
        am saying that Sports &mdash; the televised media phenomenon involving
        following favorite teams, tracking stats, and arguing about players
        &mdash; are dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is an element of this which I think nobody will disagree with.
        Everyone at some level is aware that how many times someone throws a
        ball through a hoop or carries a ball past a painted line doesn't
        matter. And yet, people defend their love for Sports with a passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        People often argue that their passion for Sports stems from their
        passion to see people reach pinnacles of human achievement and
        athleticism. But if this were the only or main reason, we would expect
        the most useful or relatable proficiencies to be the most highly
        esteemed. The fact that you know the names of more basketball players on
        a single team than you do master carpenters, ultramarathoners, and
        memory athletes combined should prove that this love for achievement is
        not the key factor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking past the facade, Sports are really just a way for us to revel in
        our tribalistic tendencies in a socially acceptable way. They start off
        as normal entertainment and offer an easy way to connect with others and
        have fun. But at some point we find ourselves transformed from spectator
        to sports fan. When the outcome of the game starts triggering an
        emotional response, the player or the team becomes a part of our
        identity. And this identification with and glorification of Sports is
        where the heart of the issue lies.
      </p>
      <p>
        What we tie our identities to, and thus what ends up getting elevated to
        celebrity status in society, is a reflection of our values. Ambitiously,
        we can think of values such as pushing the frontiers of human
        achievement or seeking fundamental truths. More simply, we can think of
        values such as living a healthy life or fostering loving relationships.
        But what values are reflected when we tie our identity to competition
        over useless games based on geographical location?
      </p>
      <p>
        While this seems like a scathing review of Sports, I actually don't have
        a problem with just watching sports. Have fun and enjoy the spectacle of
        seeing giant superhumans dunk rubber balls! Just take a step back to
        reflect the next time you find yourself upset about a certain team
        losing or arguing about what a player ought to have done. What is it you
        really care about?

      </h1>
      <h4>Published Apr. 5, 2021</h4>
      <p><em>Stick to one club. Passion stems from honing a skill.</em></p>
      <p>
        Through most of my schooling, I was almost never involved in
        extracurricular activities. Growing up, I chalked this up to my parents'
        haughty attitude towards such things and the constant refrain that
        studying was all that mattered. But reflecting on my
        <a href="/posts/do-one-thing.html" target="_blank">previous post</a>, I
        realize that there was more at play.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a steady stream of trying out what was "cool" or "strategic"
        such as basketball, Model UN, DECA, or FSAE but then dropping out after
        the first couple weeks when the novelty wore off and I realized that I
        wasn't very good. People talked about finding your passion and so I
        surmised that because I was not passionate about these activities, I
        should drop them. What nobody told me was that passion is found
        <em>by building competency</em> and not the other way around. By
        quitting everything which I didn't naturally excel at, I kept eluding
        the very thing I was chasing. It was not until starting a full-time job,
        in which quitting wasn't really an option, that I started to see the joy
        of developing a craft, regardless of what that craft is. Suddenly I
        found myself interested in things I'd never thought about in my life
        such as graphic design, public speaking, and data analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        We often poke fun at "sellout" careers such as accountant or management
        consultant. "Who ever grows up wanting to be an accountant?", we jest.
        Now don't get me wrong, having met plenty of accountants and
        consultants, I can confirm that there are no shortage of sellouts and
        people "playing it safe". But what's missed is the large number of
        people who <em>found</em> their passion as they honed their craft,
        something that those repeating the tired trope likely have not
        experienced.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hidden beauty of a club or profession is the sense of community that
        comes from surrounding yourself with people dedicated to honing the same
        craft. Through competition and camaraderie, the spark of passion grows
        into a flame. Seeming trivialities such as accounting exams or tech
        conferences become rites of passage and hotbeds of learning. So much
        depth becomes available in the simple exercise of coming to terms with
        your own incompetence. Stick to one club. Passion stems from honing a
        skill.

      <h4>Published Apr. 4, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        <em>Do one thing at a time. Stop multitasking, it's a lie.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the worst habits I had built up was trying to do more at once,
        thinking that this was the key to productivity. This idea even pervaded
        into relaxation where listening to music, reading, chatting with
        friends, watching TV were more often done in concert than alone or even
        in pairs. And my god what a cacaphony that was. What
        <em>felt</em> like speeding at 100 mph through the climax of
        <em>Limitless</em>, was really my brain working on overdrive to complete
        the most mundane tasks with minimum comprehension. Unfortunately, my
        psyche finds the intensity of the overstimulation to be far more
        addictive than the sobering reality of how half-hearted my messages were
        or the inability to recall which songs had played for the last 30
        minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overcoming that addiction to stimulation is a Herculean task. Like the
        hydra, two new notifications or recommendations pop up for every one we
        are able to ignore, leading to that all too familiar fatigue on the
        other side of a YouTube black hole. And yet, we're all aware of the
        perfect contentment, even bliss, that comes from concentrated focus. I'd
        urge my younger self to think about the conversations with friends where
        the rising sun was the only reminder of how much time had passed. To
        think about the twilight hours before an exam when stress finally took
        over and problem sets started melting away. I'd urge him to answer
        honestly which moments truly resembled happiness and productivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this realization would have been no panacea for distraction, it
        would have at least served to dispel the myth of multitasking. That it
        was not just an inability to multitask correctly but a misguided pursuit
        altogether. And in that dispelling provide at least a moment of clarity
        on what is really worth pursuing. Do one thing at a time. Stop
        multitasking, it's a lie.

        One of my top regrets in life is my abysmal class attendance in
        university. I'd imagine a plot of my class attendance vs time would look
        almost like a perfectly straight line from 100% in the first few months
        of freshman year to 20% in the final months of senior year. The regret
        does not stem from the lost GPA but rather the lost learning. I can
        already see my younger self rolling his eyes and mentally checking out.
        And as this is a directive for that younger self, this seems like a lost
        cause. But bear with me, since I think there is something that younger
        me missed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Going to class is the best way to passively learn and collect extra GPA.
        Like reading, going to class gets built up as this great virtuous
        activity; one that requires the utmost attention, pre-reads, furious
        note-taking, and questions that are 9 parts flexing your understanding
        to the other 150 kids:1 part clarification. And yes, those will all
        absolutely enrich the experience. But the beauty of class is that you
        still gain something with absolutely none of that.

      <p>
        As mentioned in Mortimer J. Adler's condescendingly yet aptly-named
        <em>How to Read a Book</em>, it's important to get the gist of a book
        before really analyzing it. On the first pass, focus on what you do
        understand, instead of what you don't. This seemingly simple advice
        contradicts most of schooling where you can't progress until you
        understand. And I think this simple shift in focus, away from frantic
        dictation to a laidback absorption of occasional insight, is what's
        missed. The rest can (but probably won't) come later. Take the freebies
        while you can. Go to class. Don't worry about notes or what you miss.
        Just show up.

        I, like most people my age, used to <em>love</em> reading as a kid. Like
        seriously love it. To the point where my mom would have to come take
        away my flashlight after a new <em>Artemis Fowl</em> or
        <em>Harry Potter</em> book came out so I wouldn't stay up all night
        reading. And yet, as I grew up and video games got fancier, broadband
        internet entered our home, and the nightmarish social pressures of
        puberty became a thing, I forgot about reading. It wasn't a strong
        conviction or anything, it just simply faded away. Reading became an
        activity for school, not for fun. And then at some point reading became
        a virtue, a painful rite of passage to show how smart you were.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, it took me a full decade to start reading again. And many
        months after that before I started reading for fun. Ten years of
        learnings gone, emotions not experienced, perspectives unchallenged. It
        was a quote from Naval Ravikant that made me realize what I got wrong 10
        years ago.
      </p>
      <blockquote cite="https://nav.al/love-read">
        Everybody I know who reads a lot loves to read, and they love to read
        because they read books that they loved. It’s a little bit of a
        catch-22, but you basically want to start off just reading wherever you
        are and then keep building up from there until reading becomes a habit.
        And then eventually, you will just get bored of the simple stuff.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        There were plenty of books that I loved to read but at some point that
        seemed like the wrong thing to do. Reading for fun was no longer cool
        and then over time, it became a big thing. A reminder to drop the
        pretense and just pick up a book, any book, when I'm restless or on
        vacation would have been great. Keep the habit, embrace the guilty
        reads! Just keep reading. Doesn't matter what, doesn't matter when,
        doesn't matter for how long. Just keep reading.

        Every time I read the work of wunderkinder like Vitalik Buterin or
        Patrick Collison, I find myself awestruck by what they had accomplished
        at such a young age. During the time in which they were reading
        cryptography papers and great Western classics, I was busy organizing
        drop parties in Varrock and PQs in Kerning City. Take Patrick's
        <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/advice" target="_blank">advice</a>
        for 10-20 year olds for example. How many 10 year olds could actually
        internalize this? I'm not even sure that I was thinking on this level at
        20 and can only hope to get there at 30.
      </p>
      <p>
        This stark difference has made me wonder what advice <em>would</em> have
        reached through to an obstinate arrogant younger me. While I don't think
        I could have convinced that self to read esoteric books or practice
        meditation, I do think that simple
        <a href="https://sive.rs/2do" target="_blank">directives</a> summarizing
        the lessons could have piqued some curiosity. And so, the next few posts
        will be my attempt at collecting some of these directives.

          You ease into your booth for a cup of coffee with friends. It took a
          bit of convincing to get people to switch cafes but you’re finally
          here: WhatsCup. You’re aware of all the cameras overhead watching your
          every move and you know it’s still owned by Facebucks, the same parent
          company as the last cafe, but hey, at least the cameras here are
          closed-circuit and there are no hidden microphones at the tables. It’s
          to help serve you better you’re reassured.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Another iced WhatsFrapp with the whip cream on the side?”, the
          barista asks.

        <p>
          You nod suspiciously; they’ve been tracking your purchases. But hey,

          shared with third parties as well. All to help serve you better you’re

          When discussing the topic of change or trying something new, I often
          hear the refrain, “I know myself, I wouldn't like X” or, “I'm not a Y
          person”. And while there is much wisdom and value in the old aphorism
          of “know thyself”, I think we would all stand to benefit by knowing
          ourselves a little less.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Yuval Noah Harari summarizes in Sapiens, humankind has been driven
          by shared, often subconscious, narratives. And while these narratives
          have enabled us to send people to the Moon, they have also served as
          the backbone of every bloody war. And while it can be easy to
          unsubscribe from shared narratives, it's important to realize that
          there are a great many <em>internal</em> narratives we carry as well.
          And similarly, our internal narratives can bring out the best and the
          worst in us.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, throughout most of my life I had a crystal clear, staunch
          understanding—nay a <em>fact</em>!— about myself, that I was not “a
          morning person”. What exactly “a morning person” was I did not know
          but I was certain that my 4:00 am – 12:00 pm sleep schedule in
          university certainly disqualified me from consideration. Fast-forward
          a couple years and after being in a situation in which I could enjoy a
          nice hot breakfast and flat white only if I woke up before 6:30 am
          (early birds do get the worms after all), I decided that the alone
          time and free meal were worth an earlier alarm. Seemingly overnight, I
          started to hear all my coworkers say how <em>they</em> could never do
          the same because they were not morning people. How could this be when
          I was not a morning person either? What had changed? All I had done
          was tap my phone a couple times to dial my alarm back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simply put, I just let go of a narrative. I learned that my “I'm not a
          morning person” narrative was as bogus as my childhood “I'm a boy and
          boys like cars” narrative. What took precedence was the narrative of
          “Of course I can do this”, a less confining and yet equally
          self-fulfilling mantra. And loosening this rigid sense of identity has
          led to so many (generally positive) changes that I'm left considering
          the ship of Theseus and how illusory this whole identity thing was to
          start with.
        </p>
        <p>
          So next time you're faced with a positive change that seems way out of
          character, don't “know thyself”. Take a second to think of whether the
          change aligns with who you <em>want to be</em> instead of who you
          <em>are</em>. And then simply try. You'll inevitably wake up at 1:00
          pm on a weekend but that's okay. Drop the “I'm failure” story and just
          try again tomorrow. You'll be surprised at who you can be when you
          stop trying to be who you are.

          After thinking about the whole logistic regression thing for a while,
          I was confused how we got to the magic e^x function considering our
          goal was merely to go from a crude linear approximation of a
          probability to a meaningful probability bounded between 0 and 1. While
          there are infinitely many ways to get there,
          <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tbgpkcxa0l">here</a> are a
          few arguably simpler examples I came up with to also achieve the same
          outcome. Notably, I was curious why we do we not use the x/abs(x)
          version when that gives us a much crisper binary outcome?[0]
        </p>

        <img
          src="/images/sigmoid-graphs.png"
          alt="graphs"
          style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px"
        />

        <p>The problem breaks down into answering the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>How can we make sure our output is positive?</li>
          <li>And how can we make sure our output is bounded at 1?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          But thinking about this, we can see that there are infinitely many
          ways to do this. So again, why an exponential?
        </p>
        <p>
          I can come up with intuitions that help us understand why we use the
          equation we use[1]: An exponential reflects the idea that an increase
          in X result in an increase in p(X) and a decrease in X results in a
          decrease in p(X). In other words, a negative coefficient means a
          decrease in probability and vice versa.[2]
        </p>
        <p>
          Exponentials? &#9745; Lines? &#9745; Squares? &#9744; Absolute?
          &#9744;
        </p>
        <p>
          An exponential, by definition, reflects the idea that the effect a
          step change in X has on p(X) depends on our current value of X.[3] In
          other words, if we’re considering the effect of income on probability
          of default, it matters whether we are going from an income of $0k–$10k
          vs $200k–$210k.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exponentials? &#9745; Lines? &#9744; Squares? &#9745; Absolute?
          &#9744;
        </p>
        <p>
          And what about the +1 in the denominator? We could have used any
          number > 0. It seems 1 is just a convenient choice to help give
          meaning to p(X) / (1-p(X)). We could just as correctly use +2 or +3,
          but then we would just be carrying around a factor of 2 or 3. So we
          just pick +1 arbitrarily to make things simpler.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hopefully these ramblings kind of help understand the seemingly
          magical appearance of e^x in this application. As with a lot of other
          statistical applications, the formula chosen is due to thoughtful
          convenience and not an absolute truth.
