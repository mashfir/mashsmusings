      <h1><a href="/posts/how-to-grok-sql.html">How to grok SQL</a></h1>
      <h4>Published Apr. 27, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        The rigidity of SQL is both a blessing and a curse. Once you "get it",
        you really get it, there are almost no surprises. But its inflexible
        syntax and difficulty to test also means that it can take some time to
        grok and lead to lots of silent errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confusingly, SQL is not executed top to bottom, the manner in which a
        human would read it. Reasoning about and reading SQL in the actual
        execution order, as outlined below, provides much greater clarity. One
        general tip is to use CTEs (Common Table Expressions AKA
        <code>WITH</code> statements) liberally to keep things organized.
      </p>
      <h2><code>FROM</code></h2>
      <p>
        The most important part of any query and where the source of most
        mistakes. Reasoning about this involves visualizing, mentally or on
        paper, the <em>full</em> expansion of each join. Make sure you can state
        exactly what the the primary keys are on each table before joining.
        Write out some rows you expect to be dropped with inner joins, some rows
        you expect to be empty with outer joins, and some rows you expect to be
        duplicated/expanded if you're not joining two tables at the exact same
        level of aggregation. Joining at the wrong level of aggregation is
        really easy and won't return any errors, quietly returning a completely
        incorrect number.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of this step you should have a sense of some giant megatable
        you're creating and be satisfied with what each row in the megatable
        represents. This is likely different than what your left-most table
        started with. Most of the columns in your megatable will never be used
        and the columns you joined on will likely be duplicated&mdash;this is
        okay.
      </p>
      <h2><code>WHERE</code></h2>
      <p>
        Once you have your megatable, decide which rows you don't need. This
        part is relatively well understood. The most common mistake seen stems
        from trying to filter on fields in joined tables when nothing was
        actually joined. Again, having a clear visualization of the megatable
        will help avoid this. Also be explicit about how you handle nulls: if A
        is null and B is 1, A != B may not do what you expect...
      </p>
      <h2><code>GROUP BY</code></h2>
      <p>
        You should know what level of aggregation you need for your
        output&mdash;<em>only group by those fields</em>! This is the second
        most common source of confusion. If you find yourself starting to group
        by numeric fields, stop! If you find yourself grouping by fields that
        are 1:1 or 1:many with your main field, stop! Really common mistakes
        would be grouping by city, state, and country or grouping by person_id,
        person_name, and title. In both of these situations, what you're really
        trying to do is just group by city or person_id first (within a CTE) and
        <em>then</em> join in the additional fields; the additional grouping
        fields are completely redundant! Adding all sorts of unnecessary
        groupings makes the query perform worse and adds confusion.
      </p>
      <h2><code>HAVING</code></h2>
      <p>
        Did you know that this even exists? <code>WHERE</code> but applied at
        the level of <code>GROUP BY</code>. Only want to find duplicates? Only
        care about groups above a certain threshold? This is where you encode
        it.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <code>SELECT</code>
      </h2>
      <p>
        While this seems like the meat and potatoes when first learning, this is
        really near the end of the process and should be straightforward after
        thinking through everything else. Be frugal with what fields you're
        pulling; a <code>SELECT *</code> might be quick to write but could slow
        you down 10x in run time. Window functions can get tricky and are
        outside of the scope of this post.
      </p>
      <h2><code>ORDER BY</code></h2>
      <p>
        You're almost there! Given how late this is in the execution, you can
        order by all the fancy new fields you defined in the last step (aside
        from window functions, womp womp).
      </p>
      <h2><code>LIMIT</code></h2>
      <p>
        You made it! Try to be frugal here as well since you probably just want
        to make sure things are working. Forgetting this can lead to some long
        wait times as your front-end tries to download 1 GB files when a few KB
        would have sufficed.

      <h4>Published Apr. 25, 2021</h4>
      <p><em>Choose less, decide more. The simplicity is well worth it.</em></p>
      <p>
        While a rationalist economist may disagree, there is a profound
        difference between choosing and deciding. Choosing is the slow process
        of weighing options against each other, creating some sort of mental
        ranking, and then reflecting on how optimal your process was
        after-the-fact. Deciding is making up your mind either ahead of time or
        within a few moments and then wholly welcoming the consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are generally taught the value of carefully choosing things. Most
        engineering and business majors can relate to the experience of taking
        entire courses related to this; Pugh matrices, Porter's Five Forces,
        SWOT analyses and other junk are pedalled to students as
        industry-standard decision making tools. Yet I can count on one hand the
        number of times I've seen any of these show up in the real world, and
        can count with no hands the number of times they were useful. There is a
        place for being choosy: when making big life decisions around where to
        live, who to be with, what our values are&mdash;but this choosy mode is
        switched on far too often and the cost paid unwittingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we focus our efforts on making sure we make the best possible
        choice for what to buy or where to eat, we rarely consider the cognitive
        load borne for these choices. We commonly spend 30 minutes deciding
        whether to eat out, an hour deciding where to go, and 15 minutes
        deciding what to order. When viewed through a maximalist lens of "did I
        choose the best thing?", it's easy to rationalize that our final choice
        from the best reviewed restaurant (cross-referenced on Google Reviews,
        Yelp, and Reddit of course) really was an improvement over the
        alternative. But the question we should really be asking ourselves is
        what is the <em>least amount of time</em> I can spend to get an outcome
        I'm satisfied with. As poker pro Annie Duke points out in
        <a
          href="https://www.annieduke.com/site/uploads/howToDecide_excerpt.pdf"
          target="_blank"
          ><em>How to Decide</em></a
        >, "The time you take to decide is time that you could be spending doing
        other things, like actually talking to the person sitting with you in
        the restaurant."
      </p>
      <p>
        The best part is that making decisions let's us have some fun while
        getting us that time back. Spending too much money on eating out? Decide
        to never order something over $11 off the menu. Spending hours agonizing
        over that next $100 purchase? Decide to make up your mind after the
        first review you read. Not sure where to eat? Decide on the first place
        on Maps over 4.5 stars that you haven't been to. Not only will you find
        this liberating, you'll also have a great conversation starter next time
        your friends end up in a battle of "I don't know, what do you wanna do?"
        Choose less, decide more. The simplicity is well worth it.

      </h1>
      <h4>Published Apr. 24, 2021</h4>
      <blockquote id="taxi-tips">
        I remember in my early trading days, at age twenty-five or so, when
        money started to become easy. I would take taxis, and if the driver
        spoke skeletal English and looked particularly depressed, I'd give him a
        $100 bill as a tip, just to give him a little jolt and get a kick out of
        his surprise. I'd watch him unfold the bill and look at it with some
        degree of consternation ($1 million would certainly have been better but
        it was not within my means). It was also a simple hedonic experiment: it
        felt elevating to make someone's day with the trifle of $100. I
        eventually stopped; we all become stingy and calculating when our wealth
        grows and we start taking money seriously.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This quote from Nassim Taleb's <em>The Black Swan</em> caught me off
        guard upon first reading and has lingered me with me since. The story
        itself is hardly memorable, something I'd expect to find in the memoirs
        of any self-absorbed Wall Street type. What really got me was the last
        line: that there is some unflattering and unintuitive stopping point for
        our generosity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading this book at age twenty-five or so, when money started to become
        easy, this was an uncomfortable pill to swallow. After a lifetime of
        parsimony, which my close friends would be too eager to confirm, I was
        very compelled by the arguments of Effective Altruism. I had paid off my
        loans, gotten a healthy raise, and realized how little you need to live
        comfortably with no dependents. The trifle of $100, while providing
        almost no marginal utility to me, could provide a significant reduction
        in the likelihood of someone contracting malaria or prevent iodine
        deficiency in hundreds of others. Tipping taxi drivers generously became
        easy, especially since most of those tips were reimbursable.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then, subconsciously and slowly, it became difficult. After another
        healthy raise and promotion, I oddly found myself second guessing my
        prior commitments. The argument for generosity was just as compelling as
        before but it <em>felt</em> a lot harder to give away money. Another
        year passes and I experience a massive increase in income; enough to
        start to question the purpose of money and its role in life. While this
        is the point where most people (naively) think they would suddenly
        become generous benefactors, I find myself growing
        <em>even stingier</em>! What kind of moral deficiency was I afflicted
        with!?
      </p>
      <p>
        I coin this relationship the <em>Parabola of Generosity</em>. I'll save
        you the bandwidth of an image with a few words. Imagine a concave
        quadratic surface with the y-axis representing generosity and x-axis
        representing wealth. Our generosity starts off very low or negative,
        constrained by our complete lack of wealth, increases up to a point in
        as we become self-aware of our relative wealth, and then decreases
        sharply thereafter. The coefficients are dependent on the individual but
        I believe that this general shape is universal (viewed locally).
      </p>
      <p>
        It was around the time of finding myself past peak generosity that I
        came across this passage from Taleb. I felt seen and understood, as if
        I'd been let in on some blas&eacute; rite of passage of the wealthy.
        Unfortunately though, I did not feel vindicated; having someone else
        articulate what I was feeling did not give me the sense of righteousness
        I would have liked.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the Parabola provides an accurate description of experience, it
        does not make a claim about <em>why</em> an inflection point exists. I
        have yet to find a more satisfactory answer than what Taleb has
        outlined: that we start taking money seriously. Wealth goes from a
        feeling of abundance to a feeling of burden. I have a sense (maybe a
        hope) that this quadratic relationship only appears so in a local sense
        and upon zooming out, the relationship becomes cubic. That we reach some
        inflection point of "fuck you" money, after which generosity begins
        increasing again. This seems to hold true for the ultra-wealthy spanning
        from the most villainized Gilded Age industrialists to Bill Gates.
        According to Wikipedia, cubic parabolas are a thing so the theory still
        stands.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for where I'm at now, I am glad to report that I have not stopped
        giving. Meditation and the occasional revisiting of works by Peter
        Singer and Will MacAskill help the reasoned part of my brain set up
        automated systems to bypass System 1. To someone experiencing something
        similar, I'd advise taking a step back to evaluate how your values have
        changed over time. If the change in wealth has outpaced the change in
        values, it's worth overcoming that stinginess&mdash;before we find
        ourselves writing our own self-absorbed Wall Street type memoirs.

        Over the last few years, fueled in part by curiosity and in part by the
        search for the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe,
        and Everything, I have tried implementing a variety of lifestyle
        changes. Most of these ideas have come from separate sources and some
        have stuck more than others (I swear I'll start working out everyday
        tomorrow). But taking a step back on some of the more impactful ones

        The clear religious bent of this list would outdo many Muslims I know.
        Yet my belief in a traditional God is no stronger than it was before. In
        fact I'd wager that the intense angst and atheist identity formed in my
        teenage years probably made me more resistant to these ideas than most.
        But here we are. Like the final zoom out on
        <a href="https://vid.puffyan.us/watch?v=IceiU-Wmnog" target="_blank"
          >Art Attack</a
        >, it is surprising how a series of small unrelated steps looks from a
        big picture lens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does this mean the seemingly arbitrary rules handed down by religions
        are really some emergent properties that arise from one's search for
        truth and contentment? If so, does that justify the use of more
        persuasive tools such as fear and shame to keep others on the path?
      </p>
      <p>
        While I leave you to ponder the former, I draw a hard line against the
        latter. It is easy, in hindsight, to preach about virtues, but applying
        pressure wantonly does more harm than good. For me, each of these habits
        came from the right conversation at the right time. And the only real
        teacher was lived experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        More insidiously, packaging virtues with negative emotions can backfire
        in a spectacular way. Discovered individually and independently, virtues
        serve as a rock solid foundation for identity; but handed down from God,
        the slightest tremor can cause the house of cards to topple into crisis.
        Inoculation means bottom-up learning. And bottom-up learning means
        making your own mistakes.

        In a couple of recent discussions with friends around books to read and
        suggestions, I drew some ire around my stance on recommendations and
        book clubs&mdash;I am not open to contemporary or topical books. This
        draws criticism without fail and yet my conviction on this has only
        strengthened.

        There is definitely an element of truth to this but, as my friend
        pointed out, the Murakami quote around the other boys being crap is
        elitist at best. While this vague call to a sense of independence is
        appealing, there is a much better reason to focus on classics.
      </p>

        As Adler points out in <em>How to Read a Book</em>, the reason to read
        classics is not to feel &quot;cultured&quot;&mdash;it's to understand
        the rich literary tradition behind everything we know. One cannot really
        understand the significance of <em>Reading Lolita in Tehran</em> without
        first reading <em>Lolita</em>. Or truly walk with Dante through Hell
        without knowing of Virgil. And this lack of understanding is often much
        worse in nonfiction. People nowadays praise Piketty's
        <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> with no knowledge of Marx's
        <em>Capital</em>, which Piketty is transparently trying to build upon.
        And of the few socialists who have actually read Marx, almost none have
        read Adam Smith, whose theories Marx was rebutting. To read only
        contemporary books is to spend your life skating on the tips of
        icebergs, blind to the centuries of thought that have led us to where we
        are today.

        Accepting this truth is one thing, but acting on it is another. This
        path can seem extremely daunting; once you start looking for predecessor
        after predecessor, you realize it's turtles all the way down. And that
        realization can be demotivating enough to justify abandoning the pursuit
        altogether. Fortunately, there are

        out there that help stop the infinite regress. While it would take many
        lifetimes to traverse the entire iceberg of human knowledge, you'll be
        surprised to see how far along you'll get simply by reading
        <em>The Odyssey</em> or <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em>.

        So dear reader, try taking that first step. Once you cross the chasm
        from Heather's Picks to Homer's Picks, you'll never look back.

      <h4>Published Apr. 18, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        I recently finished reading
        <em>"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman"</em> and found his life to be
        often profound, sometimes cringe, and consistently wonderful. Here is my
        ranking of some of his advice.
      </p>
      <h2>Words to live by</h2>
      <p>
        Above all else, always focus on <em>true</em> understanding. The kind
        which you get from experiencing, teaching others, and extrapolating
        beyond the homework. This idea was best summed up by an analogy in which
        he blasts the Brazilian physics program for its emphasis on volume and
        rote. Unfortunately, the style of education on blast has become the
        norm.
      </p>
      <blockquote id="greek-scholar">
        <p>
          Then I gave the analogy of a Greek scholar who loves the Greek
          language, who knows that in his own country there aren't many children
          studying Greek. But he comes to another country, where he is delighted
          to find everybody studying Greek&mdash;even the smaller kids in
          elementary schools. He goes to the examination of a student who is
          coming to get his degree in Greek, and asks him, &quot;What were
          Socrates' ideas on the relationship between Truth and
          Beauty?&quot;&mdash;and the student can't answer. Then he asks the
          student, &quot;What did Socrates say to Plato in the Third
          Symposium?&quot; the student lights up and goes,
          &quot;<em>Brrrrrrrrr-up</em>&quot;&mdash;he tells you everything, word
          for word, that Socrates said, in beautiful Greek.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what Socrates was talking about in the Third Symposium was the
          relationship between Truth and Beauty!
        </p>
        <p>
          What this Greek scholar discovers is, the students in another country
          learn Greek by first learning to pronounce the letters, then the
          words, and then sentences and paragraphs. They can recite, word for
          word, what Socrates said, without realizing that those Greek words
          actually
          <em>mean</em> something. To the student they are all artificial
          sounds. Nobody has ever translated them into words the student can
          understand.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Try and understand the phenomena itself instead of just the word.</p>
      <blockquote id="just-a-word">
        <p>
          The answer was, for the wind-up toy, &quot;Energy makes it go.&quot;
          And for the boy on the bicycle, &quot;Energy makes it go.&quot; For
          everything, &quot;<em>Energy</em> makes it go.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that doesn't <em>mean</em> anything... The child doesn't learn
          anything; it's just a <em>word</em>!
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Make sure you have a real example to test your understanding.</p>
      <blockquote id="physical-example">
        He thinks I'm following the steps mathematically, but that's not what
        I'm doing. I have the specific, physical example of what he's trying to
        analyze, and I know from instinct and experience the properties of the
        thing.
      </blockquote>
      <p>It is foolish to seek the wisdom of the crowd.</p>
      <blockquote id="emperor-of-china">
        This question of trying to figure out whether a book is good or bad by
        looking at it carefully or by taking the reports of a lot of people who
        looked at it carelessly is like this famous old problem: Nobody was
        permitted to see the Emperor of China, and the question was, What is the
        length of the Emperor of China's nose? To find out, you go all over the
        country asking people what they think the length of the Emperor of
        China's nose is, and you
        <em>average</em> it. And that would be very "accurate" because you
        averaged so many people. But it's no way to find anything out; when you
        have a very wide range of pople who contribute without looking carefully
        at it, you don't improve your knowledge of the situation by averaging.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Reflect on the value of what it is you're achieving. It's easy to get
        caught up in the joy of achievement.
      </p>
      <blockquote id="bob-wilson">
        <p>
          After the [atomic bomb test] went off, there was tremendous excitement
          at Los Alamos. Everybody had parties, we all ran around. I sat on the
          end of a jeep and beat drums and so on. But one man, I remember, Bob
          Wilson, was just sitting there moping.
        </p>
        <p>I said, &quot;What are you moping about?&quot;</p>
        <p>He said, &quot;It's a terrible thing that we made.&quot;</p>
        <p>I said, &quot;But you started it. You got us into it.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          You see, what happened to me&mdash;what happened to the rest of
          us&mdash;is we <em>started</em> for a good reason, then you're working
          very hard to accomplish something and it's a pleasure, it's
          excitement. And you stop thinking, you know; you just <em>stop</em>.
          Bob Wilson was the only one who was still thinking about it, in that
          moment.

      <h1><a href="/posts/sports-are-dumb.html">Sports are dumb</a></h1>
      <h4>Published Apr. 14, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        I'd imagine most people reading the title are either relieved to finally
        hear what they haven't been allowed to say their whole lives or are
        already coming up with answers for why I'm wrong. I'm not talking about
        lowercase sports, the games we play for fun, fitness, and competition. I
        am saying that Sports &mdash; the televised media phenomenon involving
        following favorite teams, tracking stats, and arguing about players
        &mdash; are dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is an element of this which I think nobody will disagree with.
        Everyone at some level is aware that how many times someone throws a
        ball through a hoop or carries a ball past a painted line doesn't
        matter. And yet, people defend their love for Sports with a passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        People often argue that their passion for Sports stems from their
        passion to see people reach pinnacles of human achievement and
        athleticism. But if this were the only or main reason, we would expect
        the most useful or relatable proficiencies to be the most highly
        esteemed. The fact that you know the names of more basketball players on
        a single team than you do master carpenters, ultramarathoners, and
        memory athletes combined should prove that this love for achievement is
        not the key factor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking past the facade, Sports are really just a way for us to revel in
        our tribalistic tendencies in a socially acceptable way.. They start off
        as normal entertainment and offer an easy way to connect with others and
        have fun. But at some point we find ourselves transformed from spectator
        to sports fan. When the outcome of the game starts triggering an
        emotional response, the player or the team becomes a part of our
        identity. And this identification with and glorification of Sports is
        where the heart of the issue lies.
      </p>
      <p>
        What we tie our identities to, and thus what ends up getting elevated to
        celebrity status in society, is a reflection of our values. Ambitiously,
        we can think of values such as pushing the frontiers of human
        achievement or seeking fundamental truths. More simply, we can think of
        values such as living a healthy life or fostering loving relationships.
        But what values are reflected when we tie our identity to competition
        over useless games based on geographical location?
      </p>
      <p>
        While this seems like a scathing review of Sports, I actually don't have
        a problem with just watching sports. Have fun and enjoy the spectacle of
        seeing giant superhumans dunk rubber balls! Just take a step back to
        reflect the next time you find yourself upset about a certain team
        losing or arguing about what a player ought to have done. What is it you
        really care about?

      <h4>Published Apr. 5, 2021</h4>
      <p><em>Stick to one club. Passion stems from honing a skill.</em></p>
      <p>
        Through most of my schooling, I was almost never involved in
        extracurricular activities. Growing up, I chalked this up to my parents'
        haughty attitude towards such things and the constant refrain that
        studying was all that mattered. But reflecting on my
        <a href="/posts/do-one-thing.html" target="_blank">previous post</a>, I
        realize that there was more at play.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a steady stream of trying out what was "cool" or "strategic"
        such as basketball, Model UN, DECA, or FSAE but then dropping out after
        the first couple weeks when the novelty wore off and I realized that I
        wasn't very good. People talked about finding your passion and so I
        surmised that because I was not passionate about these activities, I
        should drop them. What nobody told me was that passion is found
        <em>by building competency</em> and not the other way around. By
        quitting everything which I didn't naturally excel at, I kept eluding
        the very thing I was chasing. It was not until starting a full-time job,
        in which quitting wasn't really an option, that I started to see the joy
        of developing a craft, regardless of what that craft is. Suddenly I
        found myself interested in things I'd never thought about in my life
        such as graphic design, public speaking, and data analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        We often poke fun at "sellout" careers such as accountant or management
        consultant. "Who ever grows up wanting to be an accountant?", we jest.
        Now don't get me wrong, having met plenty of accountants and
        consultants, I can confirm that there are no shortage of sellouts and
        people "playing it safe". But what's missed is the large number of
        people who <em>found</em> their passion as they honed their craft,
        something that those repeating the tired trope likely have not
        experienced.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hidden beauty of a club or profession is the sense of community that
        comes from surrounding yourself with people dedicated to honing the same
        craft. Through competition and camaraderie, the spark of passion grows
        into a flame. Seeming trivialities such as accounting exams or tech
        conferences become rites of passage and hotbeds of learning. So much
        depth becomes available in the simple exercise of coming to terms with
        your own incompetence. Stick to one club. Passion stems from honing a
        skill.

      <h4>Published Apr. 4, 2021</h4>
      <p>
        <em>Do one thing at a time. Stop multitasking, it's a lie.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the worst habits I had built up was trying to do more at once,
        thinking that this was the key to productivity. This idea even pervaded
        into relaxation where listening to music, reading, chatting with
        friends, watching TV were more often done in concert than alone or even
        in pairs. And my god what a cacaphony that was. What
        <em>felt</em> like speeding at 100 mph through the climax of
        <em>Limitless</em>, was really my brain working on overdrive to complete
        the most mundane tasks with minimum comprehension. Unfortunately, my
        psyche finds the intensity of the overstimulation to be far more
        addictive than the sobering reality of how half-hearted my messages were
        or the inability to recall which songs had played for the last 30
        minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overcoming that addiction to stimulation is a Herculean task. Like the
        hydra, two new notifications or recommendations pop up for every one we
        are able to ignore, leading to that all too familiar fatigue on the
        other side of a YouTube black hole. And yet, we're all aware of the
        perfect contentment, even bliss, that comes from concentrated focus. I'd
        urge my younger self to think about the conversations with friends where
        the rising sun was the only reminder of how much time had passed. To

        over and problem sets started melting away. I'd urge him to answer
        honestly which moments truly resembled happiness and productivity.

        While this realization would have been no panacea for distraction, it
        would have at least served to dispel the myth of multitasking. That it
        was not just an inability to multitask correctly but a misguided pursuit
        altogether. And in that dispelling provide at least a moment of clarity
        on what is really worth pursuing. Do one thing at a time. Stop
        multitasking, it's a lie.

        One of my top regrets in life is my abysmal class attendance in
        university. I'd imagine a plot of my class attendance vs time would look
        almost like a perfectly straight line from 100% in the first few months
        of freshman year to 20% in the final months of senior year. The regret
        does not stem from the lost GPA but rather the lost learning. I can
        already see my younger self rolling his eyes and mentally checking out.
        And as this is a directive for that younger self, this seems like a lost
        cause. But bear with me, since I think there is something that younger
        me missed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Going to class is the best way to passively learn and collect extra GPA.
        Like reading, going to class gets built up as this great virtuous
        activity; one that requires the utmost attention, pre-reads, furious
        note-taking, and questions that are 9 parts flexing your understanding
        to the other 150 kids:1 part clarification. And yes, those will all
        absolutely enrich the experience. But the beauty of class is that you
        still gain something with absolutely none of that.

        As mentioned in Mortimer J. Adler's condescendingly yet aptly-named
        <em>How to Read a Book</em>, it's important to get the gist of a book
        before really analyzing it. On the first pass, focus on what you do
        understand, instead of what you don't. This seemingly simple advice
        contradicts most of schooling where you can't progress until you
        understand. And I think this simple shift in focus, away from frantic
        dictation to a laidback absorption of occasional insight, is what's
        missed. The rest can (but probably won't) come later. Take the freebies
        while you can. Go to class. Don't worry about notes or what you miss.
        Just show up.

        I, like most people my age, used to <em>love</em> reading as a kid. Like
        seriously love it. To the point where my mom would have to come take
        away my flashlight after a new <em>Artemis Fowl</em> or
        <em>Harry Potter</em> book came out so I wouldn't stay up all night
        reading. And yet, as I grew up and video games got fancier, broadband
        internet entered our home, and the nightmarish social pressures of
        puberty became a thing, I forgot about reading. It wasn't a strong
        conviction or anything, it just simply faded away. Reading became an
        activity for school, not for fun. And then at some point reading became
        a virtue, a painful rite of passage to show how smart you were.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, it took me a full decade to start reading again. And many
        months after that before I started reading for fun. Ten years of
        learnings gone, emotions not experienced, perspectives unchallenged. It
        was a quote from Naval Ravikant that made me realize what I got wrong 10
        years ago.
      </p>
      <blockquote cite="https://nav.al/love-read">
        Everybody I know who reads a lot loves to read, and they love to read
        because they read books that they loved. It’s a little bit of a
        catch-22, but you basically want to start off just reading wherever you
        are and then keep building up from there until reading becomes a habit.
        And then eventually, you will just get bored of the simple stuff.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        There were plenty of books that I loved to read but at some point that
        seemed like the wrong thing to do. Reading for fun was no longer cool
        and then over time, it became a big thing. A reminder to drop the
        pretense and just pick up a book, any book, when I'm restless or on
        vacation would have been great. Keep the habit, embrace the guilty
        reads! Just keep reading. Doesn't matter what, doesn't matter when,
        doesn't matter for how long. Just keep reading.

        Every time I read the work of wunderkinder like Vitalik Buterin or
        Patrick Collison, I find myself awestruck by what they had accomplished
        at such a young age. During the time in which they were reading
        cryptography papers and great Western classics, I was busy organizing
        drop parties in Varrock and PQs in Kerning City. Take Patrick's
        <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/advice" target="_blank">advice</a>
        for 10-20 year olds for example. How many 10 year olds could actually
        internalize this? I'm not even sure that I was thinking on this level at
        20 and can only hope to get there at 30.
      </p>
      <p>
        This stark difference has made me wonder what advice <em>would</em> have
        reached through to an obstinate arrogant younger me. While I don't think
        I could have convinced that self to read esoteric books or practice
        meditation, I do think that simple
        <a href="https://sive.rs/2do" target="_blank">directives</a> summarizing
        the lessons could have piqued some curiosity. And so, the next few posts
        will be my attempt at collecting some of these directives.

          When discussing the topic of change or trying something new, I often
          hear the refrain, “I know myself, I wouldn't like X” or, “I'm not a Y
          person”. And while there is much wisdom and value in the old aphorism
          of “know thyself”, I think we would all stand to benefit by knowing
          ourselves a little less.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Yuval Noah Harari summarizes in Sapiens, humankind has been driven
          by shared, often subconscious, narratives. And while these narratives
          have enabled us to send people to the Moon, they have also served as
          the backbone of every bloody war. And while it can be easy to
          unsubscribe from shared narratives, it's important to realize that
          there are a great many <em>internal</em> narratives we carry as well.
          And similarly, our internal narratives can bring out the best and the
          worst in us.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, throughout most of my life I had a crystal clear, staunch
          understanding—nay a <em>fact</em>!— about myself, that I was not “a
          morning person”. What exactly “a morning person” was I did not know
          but I was certain that my 4:00 am – 12:00 pm sleep schedule in
          university certainly disqualified me from consideration. Fast-forward
          a couple years and after being in a situation in which I could enjoy a
          nice hot breakfast and flat white only if I woke up before 6:30 am
          (early birds do get the worms after all), I decided that the alone
          time and free meal were worth an earlier alarm. Seemingly overnight, I
          started to hear all my coworkers say how <em>they</em> could never do
          the same because they were not morning people. How could this be when
          I was not a morning person either? What had changed? All I had done
          was tap my phone a couple times to dial my alarm back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simply put, I just let go of a narrative. I learned that my “I'm not a
          morning person” narrative was as bogus as my childhood “I'm a boy and
          boys like cars” narrative. What took precedence was the narrative of
          “Of course I can do this”, a less confining and yet equally
          self-fulfilling mantra. And loosening this rigid sense of identity has
          led to so many (generally positive) changes that I'm left considering
          the ship of Theseus and how illusory this whole identity thing was to
          start with.
        </p>
        <p>
          So next time you're faced with a positive change that seems way out of
          character, don't “know thyself”. Take a second to think of whether the
          change aligns with who you <em>want to be</em> instead of who you
          <em>are</em>. And then simply try. You'll inevitably wake up at 1:00
          pm on a weekend but that's okay. Drop the “I'm failure” story and just
          try again tomorrow. You'll be surprised at who you can be when you
          stop trying to be who you are.

          After thinking about the whole logistic regression thing for a while,
          I was confused how we got to the magic e^x function considering our
          goal was merely to go from a crude linear approximation of a
          probability to a meaningful probability bounded between 0 and 1. While
          there are infinitely many ways to get there,
          <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tbgpkcxa0l">here</a> are a
          few arguably simpler examples I came up with to also achieve the same
          outcome. Notably, I was curious why we do we not use the x/abs(x)
          version when that gives us a much crisper binary outcome?[0]
        </p>

        <img src="/images/sigmoid-graphs.png" alt="graphs" width="500px" />

        <p>The problem breaks down into answering the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>How can we make sure our output is positive?</li>
          <li>And how can we make sure our output is bounded at 1?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          But thinking about this, we can see that there are infinitely many
          ways to do this. So again, why an exponential?
        </p>
        <p>
          I can come up with intuitions that help us understand why we use the
          equation we use[1]: An exponential reflects the idea that an increase
          in X result in an increase in p(X) and a decrease in X results in a
          decrease in p(X). In other words, a negative coefficient means a
          decrease in probability and vice versa.[2]
        </p>
        <p>Exponentials? :check: Lines? :check: Squares? :x: Absolute? :x:</p>
        <p>
          An exponential, by definition, reflects the idea that the effect a
          step change in X has on p(X) depends on our current value of X.[3] In
          other words, if we’re considering the effect of income on probability
          of default, it matters whether we are going from an income of $0k–$10k
          vs $200k–$210k.
        </p>
        <p>Exponentials? :check: Lines? :x: Squares? :check: Absolute? :x:</p>
        <p>
          And what about the +1 in the denominator? We could have used any
          number > 0. It seems 1 is just a convenient choice to help give
          meaning to p(X) / (1-p(X)). We could just as correctly use +2 or +3,
          but then we would just be carrying around a factor of 2 or 3. So we
          just pick +1 arbitrarily to make things simpler.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hopefully these ramblings kind of help understand the seemingly
          magical appearance of e^x in this application. As with a lot of other
          statistical applications, the formula chosen is due to thoughtful
          convenience and not an absolute truth.
        </p>

          [0] You can just as legitimately use x/abs(x) to create your own

        <p>
          [1] These may not be the actual reasons why this equation was chosen…
        </p>
        <p>
          [2] I guess this really just means that we want dy/dx > 0 for all x?
        </p>
